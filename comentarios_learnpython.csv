ctkypf,exlnp9w,XOchosiX,Hey this is a great write-up.  Thanks for sharing what you have learned along the way.,2019-08-21 19:36:28
ctkypf,exlm3vv,yabadababoo,"This is very inspiring. I am like you were in the beginning and need a way out of this pit!

How many of these interviews did you do till it worked out?

Is there a lot of demand for junior level django / python?

What are these kinds of jobs paying?

How did you manage in your first week there? Did you feel overwhelmed or were you very confident?",2019-08-21 19:22:03
ctkypf,exlnnyp,marlowe221,"Thank you so much for posting this! May I ask how long it was from the time you started learning to program until you were in a position to look for a job?

I am near the beginning of this path and, like you, am interested in a web developer route. I also do NOT have a CS degree (I'm a lawyer) and am teaching myself Python in my spare time (HTML/CSS/JS are next on the docket).

My wife suggested that I might think about ways to translate my skills as an attorney to the world of software development when the day comes for job interviews. For example, I am trained to understand complicated legal and regulatory schemes and break them down  into parts and explain them to lay persons. I know how to write in a proscribed language and syntax (ever hear of 'legalese'?) in order to attempt to produce a desired outcome. I am trained to read and understand long, complex text that is often self-referential and has a looping structure that contains LOTS of conditional logic (i.e. - laws and regulations). And I know how to take a big project and break it down to small, manageable steps that must all fit together to complete a larger task. 

Do you think there is any value in t any of that, assuming that I build the knowledge and portfolio to go with it?",2019-08-21 19:36:08

This line kinda does a bit. The rest of your post however is awesome. Don't pull yourself down. It's a victory for you. Enjoy it and share the happiness like you're doing now. Your enthusiasm is your drive to keep going so don't make it a small thing even to others. It'll affect you too.    

I think what you built is awesome. I often talk with API's and handle the data but I have no idea how to download a file yet. I'd have to look it up. I never had the need to.

**careful!** it's great that you were able to get this to work, but:

1. do other companies integrate this into their workflow in the *exact same* way?
2. how will you handle distribution
3. it's a simple python script: how will you protect the intellectual property?
4. is this code thoroughly tested, reliable, and, most importantly, **secure**

Be careful before you move forward, especially if you don't have a ton of programming knowledge and your boss is about to make a bunch of promises on your behalf!

I asked ""how long does this usually take?"" She responded ""about 8 hours a week"". I was astonished and it was a simple task. I set up a quick VLOOKUP script in excel which auto did the task (albeit more accurately since it was hundreds of items). Took less than a second to do what took her 8 hours. She told me she was finally able to the rest of her work done on time.

This wasn't anything complex and a simple fix. I cannot imagine how many other things could be fixed or sped up by basic tasks like that. I dont get how people dont try to search for a better option. She didn't lose her job luckily, but its concerning.",2020-08-19 17:43:30

She could have been moved to another team, retrained on another system faster than a new hire who doesn't know your company, doing something higher level with the imaging docs, or working with documents less amenable to automation like work on sales enquiries, minutes of meetings, audit or compliance reports or whatever seems appropriate.

Unless she doesn't want to do anything else, the idea that people can only do exactly one task they were hired for and if that task is gone, they have to go too, is really short-sighted.

EDIT: The promise of automation is that we as a society can earn more for less work. The more we automate, the more we as a whole can be free. In reality this is not the case; we live in a society where people live to serve the bottom line, and not other people. Toying around with automation is fun, and can help free up a lot of time so that you can do more things you enjoy, but just be VERY careful with disclosing your automation work to others, as I have seen time and time again how it can negatively affect other peoples lively hood. If an organization gets even a whiff that a job can be automated, they will do it, cut loose the employee, and MAYBE give you a pat on the back for ""increasing efficiency.""

I was earlier a normal tech in some high tech maintenance field. After some time I got some guys I was responsible for and planning was becoming my thing.

The system to plan the work was horrible and we could not really do internally a lot because decisions of the maker of the machines we maintain. I needed to go three different sites, tick some fields, look data here and there. Every week rinse and repeat for hundreds of machines.

I got frustrated and automated one site with VBA + Python. Then another. Soon I added some other automation to my planning program. And then I started planning stuff by automating stuff which was not needed per se.

My manager got interested how on earth I am leading double the amount of guys others are and doing a lot of extra customer care, financial budgeting and whatever on top of that while others are burning out with less.

Fast forward few years and a lot DAX, Power Query, VBA, Python, ERP development, API development, technical documentations, leadership trainings, financial trainings and shit and I am responsible for over 70 guys, my pay check has doubled, I am still under 30 and I've got no idea wtf has happened. 

Feels good though and pretty much every day I learn some exciting stuff. Sometimes it is still some DAX or Python, but more and more it is some financial or law stuff somewhere. I really love my work, and as a some kind of leader of sorts I don't have time for everything I'd like to.

Essentially, what specific areas (and since you're going to be answering questions for 12 hours I'm gonna be a punk and ask this) would you expect to see someone be proficient in as a beginner, intermediate, and expert in python (or programming in general)?

f48ojm,fhoskgl,understatement222,"A similar thing happened to me too. Seven month ago I took this front office job in which we had to wait for the first 2 months for the project to come in the country. Instead of spending those 2 months slacking off, because we literally had nothing to do, I started watching python tutorials. Fast forward 2 months, the project came. I quickly noticed the fact that in order to handle most of the tasks we had to cross check with a lot of excels with a lot of sheets. I used tkinter and openpyxl to create just one graphical interface for all the files. I have also used pyautogui to make some tasks handle themselves. Fast forward one month, I am in the books for a promotion for Service Matter Expert on automation amd I've been given automation related tasks. This happened only because I decided solve problems in a different way than the rest, even when no one asked me to. 

And just as a note, I graduated with a degree in Advertising, no connection to the IT field, no previous experience. My current job is filled with 70% to 80% people that either graduated or are in the course of studying computer science. The rest of 30 to 20% of people is composed by people that actually speak the language  that we work in, since it is not our native language or English. I had neither of those, only motivation to work and learn. Don't let yourself get scared by your lack of background or the level of the people that you are amongst.

If something is estimated to be 3 weeks deadline, if you know you can do it in 1 day, don’t turn it in that fast.  The bottom line is that if you turn in work 20x faster than expected, they won’t suddenly pay you 20x more.  They’ll identify you as a person with a character flaw who will overly sacrifice themself to win the approval of everyone else and they’ll pivot to begin abusing that as much as possible.  Knowing this as fact, you gain a lot by really thinking a project through, making it as ideal as possible, taking company time to hone and learn all methods necessary for the project, no rush, be happy to know you’re well within deadline and keep that information to yourself.",2020-02-15 18:00:10

I've already gotten to the point where I am able to write Python scripts for automating a few things in my job.

It teaches at a reasonable pace - nothing is dragged out.  You learn important concepts that often catch beginners out (speaking from experience!).  The content is presented in a fun and upbeat manner, and each lesson has a re-cap of everything covered at the end of the videos.

I'm still very much a beginner, but this course has been superb for learning the basics and foundational Python skills you'll be using all throughout your coding journey!

q8iyu7,hgrojco,ELIMINADO,"Terrified to hit run, haha. Perhaps incorporate a method to print the email before sending, for a quick visual verification. You can set user input to send the email something super efficient like so,

for email in emailsObj:  
….print(email)  
….if input() == ‘’:  
……..send(email)  
….else:  
……..dontSend(email)  

Sorry about that formatting. I’m on mobile. Anyhow, the ‘’ is an empty string. You just hit <enter> and that satisfies it. Hitting anything else will push to the else: Statement. dontSend() could include an object with each email you chose not to send appended to it, and after you finish running through the email send verification you can have the code go back to the ones you didn’t send for correction.

You can also put in a separate object that tracks all sent emails and use it to verify ones that are about to be sent haven’t been already, to prevent duplicates. Lots of fun ideas, just keep optimizing the code and adding helpful features. 


Be sure to document your code with comments though, even if you’re the only person to use it. IT will thank you if it ever becomes a shadow system and they’re tasked with reverse engineering it, plus comments will save you time as the program becomes for advanced.",2021-10-15 18:22:30

Only, in the context of programming it is actually good advice. Especially since file versioning not only allows restoring previous versions, but also comparing the changes and who made them.

For private-use scripts, it usually ends up a single linear history for me. But even then, tracking if the changes can be quite more helpful than just storing the old version.

We're different though, we're programmers! ""Why is this broken?"" ""How does this work?"" ""Can I make this better?"" those are the hardest things to stick to your brain when starting out.

Learning to program isn't so much as to just learn the language, it's to get into that mentality, breaking things down into their simplest steps, then going on-by-on into them, just like IKEA furniture instructions.

Hell you can even apply that to anything in your life, car issues? Break it down! Painting a room? Break it down! Doing yard work? BREAK IT DOWN! 

Once you get down the mentality, you can learn any language. It's just a matter of knowing the syntax and the usability.

It's okay to walk away for a moment and rest. If you're stuck, walk away and rest your mind, whether it's with a book, a game, music, or a nap. Many times, the answer will present itself to you after that moment away.

Not grasping something? Look to see how someone else explains it.

After you read it, do it. After you do it, teach it. That will cement your understanding and serves to not only self-identify your weaknesses but also gives you the best chance at mastering something.

**BEST PROGRAMMER ADVICE**: rubber duck. Get one and put it on your desk. If you're stumped and know that something should work but it doesn't, walk the duck through the problem, what you've done, and why you believe it should work. Communicating the problem uses a different part of your brain and allows you to see parts of the problem you may not have been acutely aware of before.

Once you've spent 3 hours writing it, you can turn around and write it in 10 minutes, too. :-)

Figure programming is made up of two things:

* Figuring out how to solve the problem
* Actually making code that does it.

Each time you spend 3h researching how to do something, that's 3h you won't need to spend the next time you want to do that same thing. And the more times you do the ""solve the problem"" part, the better you'll get at it.

>Build your Github as soon as you can

Worth noting that you don't need github to use git. ""git init"" in any directory and you can check your code in locally. Even if you have no intention of sharing the code, you can still get a lot of benefit from using git locally in the form of being able to go back to previous iterations of your code. Gone are the ""what did I do? this was working before"" moments. And if it eventually turns into something you do want to share, it's easy to push that entire local repo to an online repo.

&#x200B;

>""Come up with your own ideas and then build them""

Way easier said than done, as you've discovered. I've never really thought about something like Upwork as a means of getting an ""assignment"" to work on.

drnc0z,f6jw9h3,AlSweigart,"The code is NOV2019FREE or you can use this link: https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/?couponCode=NOV2019FREE

To head off any questions:

* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers the same content as the book, which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python will be posted on the website in mid-November. It gets released on the 12th, and I'll need a couple days to format it to HTML and make it look nice.
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid- or late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* I used to do free codes once or twice a year. The last time I did, I had an amazing 80,000 people sign up (so a dozen of them might have actually finished the course, if people are as good as I am about finishing the online courses I sign up for). Udemy's new policies mean I can't do this anymore. I find this to be a less than ideal situation. So I'm rolling out new codes each month. NOV2019FREE is the free code, and NOV2019 is the cheap code. I'll come out with new ones at the start of each month. (And yes, I'll probably write a script to automate this.)",2019-11-04 20:59:32

k51frp,gec8cfu,NohPhD,"Congratulations!

It’s easy and great writing a script here and there to automate some irksome or onerous task. It’s much, much more difficult to create an ecosystem of scripts that reuse functions and integrate together smoothly. It’s extremely difficult for a single person to develop an entire system. Be conscious of what you are trying to create. 

Always think about how to reuse that quick little script that you wrote. 

Doc strings are your friends. 

When creating a report, always print the name of the generating script with a date and time stamp in a banner so you immediately know how to get the report next month/quarter.

Print each function and put it in a three ring binder so it’s easy to flip through and refresh yourself what the expected input and output are. 

If you are not using Git or some other version control system, you are building your own software version of the Titanic.  Been there, done that.. 

Good luck!",2020-12-02 05:02:49

Class names should use the CapWords convention and there's no need to have the pair of parentheses after (unless you're inheriting from another class) so your class declaration should just be `class Cat:`. The parentheses when you instantiate an instance of the class are either empty to create an instance without passing any attributes or they pass those attributes to the `__init__` method of the class.

Also by putting `breed` as a class attribute you're applying it to all cats - doing it like that, you can only have one breed of cat among all of your cat instances, instead of a unique breed for each one if you put it as an instance attribute instead. This is obviously just an example you've put together so it could be nothing but I thought it was worth pointing out.",2020-05-19 08:41:18

vbjg65,ic9omdv,fernly,"From another comment:

> changing the format of some of the data, dropping unneeded columns, adding more columns with static data based on other entries, then using formulas to pull data that I need to report on.

Design tip: break these up into separate steps. Use the command line, and write real simple scripts to this pattern,

    $ python3 fix_formats.py original.cvs reformat.cvs
    $ python3 drop_columns.py reformat.cvs droppedcols.cvs

etc., where each script takes an input .cvs file name and an output file name.

The point of this is to greatly simplify the programming task. Each script does just one thing, and you have its output file to inspect to make sure it did it right (or how it did it wrong). When it's all working you can use a shell script to run them all one after the other -- or at that point you can write a master python script to call the others. When that's working you can think about writing an interactive program using TKinter, which is a completely different job, but will be easy if you can depend on the previous parts being tested and working right.",2022-06-14 00:08:11

I have been a programmer for many, many years.  Back in the day, I was a Lotus Notes developer, and the company I worked for decided they didn't want to pay for the licenses any more.  They wanted to go another direction.  So, I did some research and decided that PHP would be a good choice.

One problem: I didn't know PHP.  

Now, at this point I had developed in many languages, and have had to learn on my feet.  I even had to learn tcl to do a project for PlanetFeedback.com.  That was a treat (ahem).  

So... I started learning PHP.  I jumped onto a PHP forum (this was before reddit), and absorbed everything I could, while going through tutorials. Pretty soon, I was helping others with their problems.  We also did fun challenges, like ""write the song 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall in as few lines as possible.""

6 months after I began, I was approached by Wiley Publishing, and became a co-author of a PHP book!

My advice: Don't think of it as learning, like school, where you have to study and worry about your lack of knowledge.  Look at it like a fun hobby, and don't just look for help here in the sub, but help others whenever you can.  As you have already figured out, it's *very* rewarding :)

Great job, keep it up!

Edit: Wanted to add, I'm a python noob myself.  As in, I decided to jump in yesterday.  I am a developer for the county I live in, and I may have some need to do python projects in the future.  So... here I go again.  I'm excited for the future!  Look for my book in a year or so LMAO",2020-04-29 17:19:13

I did something similar for my wife who is a teacher. According to her contract, she is to be paid for all hours worked but they were stiffing her and all the other teachers for recess duty and lunch duty (15min a pop). When a grievance was filed, they said “you can manually submit your timesheets for the hours worked”. Any sheet that was incorrect would not payout. And there was a deadline of 2 days on top of regular teaching responsibilities. 

They gave them a blank pdf that only covered 5 days of a pay period but wanted to account for that too so every 2 sheets had the same pay period. It also had to account for grading period too so you couldn’t just print off a bunch of sheets with the majority of info filled in already. 

I had her put together a spreadsheet with her times per day(didn’t have duty every day because of holidays, assemblies, and closings) and made a script to took the template pdf and filled it in accordingly. 

Saved a few hours of printing these out and filling in the sheets accurately. And more importantly, she got the money that was owed her... ~$800.


P.S. I have another story about a 2-3rd? grade student who was given a dumb assignment by her math teacher. “Write all the numbers from 1-1000”. That’s it. There is no lesson in that; it’s just tedious busy work.

Anyway, her mom is a mathematician and pythonista so she had her make a loop program to write all the numbers and print it out to paper. I suggested she should have put a “typo” in it to challenge the teacher to actually grade it if she was going to make the kids do that punishment of an assignment.",2020-04-29 18:10:40

Its been a month and I don't know where my direction is? Still there trying to master functions, list, tuples and all, still afraid of inheritance and OOP, all the courage I have is to go to w3schools and practice all the new syntax. I have completed the python for dummies book until it got to AI and neural networks stuff. Most of the specified code  during these topics, didn't run and I found no solution on stackoverflow or google that I can understand and apply. That's where my mind started going bonkers. I don't have any outlet for this kind of stuff building up in my head. Neither do I have any place like you where I can actually apply what I learn.

Most courses show you the CSV module or how to code a read CSV function before teaching you an improved workflow using Pandas for data science tasks. I think that your point is valid, but some people are interested in learning Python for data science and may want to jump in to that quickly. Even using the CSV module versus coding the function yourself is an abstraction.

Some people view stuff like Python more of as tools rather than Languages. People like these don't care about Software Architectures and Optimizations, they just want something that works and works well. It's like using excel but with extra steps.

**Developers** SHOULD learn how to do raw Python or any raw language they need to use before diving into frameworks and libraries (to an extent). You shouldn't be using a robust library all together if your script is very simple, but that is part of optimization and architecture.

Right now there are 2 very distinct groups of people who use python. Data Scientists and Developers. 

Developers may or may not have some background in another language, and are looking to make efficient applications. Learning the details will help then do just that. 

Data Scientists on the other hand mostly certainly already had some experience with other ways to manipulate data like excel. If you make simple tasks in excel too difficult in python, it will likely make then quit. Besides, the example already make them familiar with the dataframe object. It's very likely that 95% of their time they will spend manipulating dataframes. 

If you are worried that we are teaching the dataframe object too soon, get a R studio tutorial and look how long it takes for then to teach DataFrames. A Data Scientist have similar needs.",2020-03-24 16:48:33

As you can feel, it's considered a punishment because beginners ask the same questions again and again: lists, functions, strings, files, etc. and it's quite tedious to repeat answers.

I love these problems.  They are good, and the difficulty scales pretty well - mostlhy.

But problem 5 is a lot harder than the others, because web scraping is a dark art.  You have to use something like the requests library, and a lot of site owners restrict web scraping.  Then the code you get is often really messy, so you end up needing something like beautiful soup to make it more manageable.

So I'd make it easier like this:

* Find a web page that interests you.
* Use ctrl-u to view the source code of that page
* copy the page's code and paste it in a text editor
* save the code to a local file
* write your program to read the code

This solution manually downloads the page code so you can get to the content you want (even through menus and other stuff) then work with it.

But you still have the complexity of HTML as a data source.  You might think about learning how to use the beautiful soup library to grab specific elements you are interested in working with.

I have a video on this (and reading APIs) that I can make available if people want it.",2021-02-05 19:33:05
ld5c3e,gm4j73p,gisgeekster,"These are some great ideas! I also recommend trying to automate anything you currently are doing that may be tedious.

For example:

1. Calculate the size of folders in a directory to see which ones take the most space.

2. Download and unzip a bunch of files.  A good site to try this on would be https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2020PL/LAYER/COUNTY/2020/. Try downloading counties for a selected set of states instead of all of them to make it a little harder.

3. Reorganize your pictures by renaming them based on the date the picture was taken.

4. Download some COVID data in a spreadsheet and do some calculations like average number of cases over a 7-day period, find the highest number of cases in a day, or calculate the number of cases per 100,000 people. Here’s a good source of data for the US: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data. This is a great way to learn the Pandas library.",2021-02-05 15:40:18

You'll need everything up to intermediate to have any chance of passing a tech interview if you want to do this as a career. Hopefully, this provides some framework for you to get started on:

## Beginner

* Data Types - Lists, Strings, Tuples, Sets, Floats, Ints, Booleans, Dictionaries
* Control Flow/Looping - for loops, while loops, if/elif/else
* Arithmetic and expressions
* I/O (Input/Output) - Sys module, Standard input/output, reading/writing files  
* Functions
* Exceptions and Error Handling
* Basics of object oriented programming (OOP) (Simple classes).

## Intermediate

* Recursion
* More advanced OOP - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Method overloading.
* Data Structures - Linked lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Graphs, Minimum Spanning Trees, Hash Maps
* Algorithms - Linear Search, Binary Search, Hashing, Quicksort, Insertion/Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Radix Sort, Depth First Search, Breathe First Search, Prim's Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm.
* Algorithmic Complexity

## Advanced - A.I. / Machine Learning/ Data science

* Statistics
* Probability
* Brute Force search
* Heuristic search (Manhattan Distance, Admissible and Informed Heuristics)
* Hill Climbing
* Simulated Annealing
* A\* search
* Adversarial Search (Minimax & Alpha-Beta pruning)
* Greedy Algorithms
* Dynamic Programming
* Genetic Algorithms
* Artificial Neural Networks
* Backpropagation
* Natural Language Processing
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Recurrent Neural Networks
* Generative Adversarial Networks

## Advanced - Full stack web development

* Computer networks (Don't need to go into heavy detail but an understanding is necessary)
* Backend web dev tools (flask, django) (This is for app logic, interfacing with databases etc).
* Front end framework (This is for communicating with the backend) (Angular 6+, React/Redux)
* With frontend you'll also need - HTML, CSS, Javascript (also good to learn typescript which is using in angular. It makes writing javascript nicer).
* Relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
* Non-relational (MongoDB)
* Cloud computing knowledge is good, (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)

## Resources

### Books

* Automate the boring stuff
* Algorithms and Data structures in Python by Goldwasser (Intermediate level)
* Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science
* Slither into Python: An Introduction to the Python programming language
* Fluent Python - Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming

Here's some ones for other related and important topics:

* Clean Code by Robert Martin (How to write good code)
* The Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt (General software engineering / best practices)
* Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (Networks, useful depending on the field you're entering, anything internet based this stuff will be important)
* The Linux Command Line, 2nd Edition (Install the Linux operating system and get used to using the command line, it'll be your best friend).
* Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach

### Online courses:

I am not a fan of youtube for learning as you're just being hand-fed code and not being given any exercises to practice with so I won't be linking youtube video series here. In fact I'm not a fan of video courses in general but these two are good.

* Udemy - Complete Python Masterclass (This is for beginners stage).
* Coursera - Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng (Advanced - A.I.)

Most importantly, practice, practice, practice. You won't get anywhere just watching videos of others programming. Try dedicate an hour a day or 2 hours a day on the weekend if you can.",2019-10-28 17:21:18

hmvnt1,fx82c40,73tada,"I haven't had time to read the regex book, however your 'entire book link' (from your previous post) finally inspired me to look into Markdown (which has been tremendous time save for me).

One suggestion would be to tie the books to a website, (preferably yours) where someone could directly test and implement your regex examples. There are certainly third party sites that do this, however directing someone away from your publications can lead to lost sales.

You've put a lot of work into the book and you can maximize your visibility with this sort of option as we all want instant gratification these days.

You may have already done this, although if so I couldn't find an easy to access link to do so. 

Also, github is sort of a place for people who already know some of this stuff, I skimmed the first few pages of text and it seems you are writing towards a more advanced user. If that is your intent then that is great. 

I'm a haphazard programmer who tries to use the easiest tool (for me) available. PHP, javascript for web stuff, C for embedded, and Python for everything else. I go to stackoverflow for most of my immediate questions, especially regex. I'll install Pandas before thinking to hard about regex to sift data.

I guess what I am trying to say is your book might be too in-depth for many people. Maybe you would consider adding a 'beginner's tutorial' that later references your more advanced material?

Tie that into your website and you've got your self a winner.

Regardless, thanks for making your ebook free!",2020-07-07 17:20:49
hmvnt1,fx8rbo4,DrBobHope,"Took a quick glance through it, and I'd argue its actually just the right level of depth for beginner users, and the more adept user. It has all the basics, and later on, goes into some of the more advanced/extensive uses you can have with regex (and additional reading for anyone who wants more advanced uses).   


However, there isn't quite an introduction. The book is partitioned less like a book, and more like documentation (i.e. here is first regex function, lets break down this function, then next function, etc.). If people are looking at this with no knowledge of regex, they are immediately thrown into a rabbit hole of different uses of regex, without understanding why they'd need it in the first place or what it can do. 

I'd recommend adding a brief introduction, i.e. regex is this, and it can do something like this. If you take:  [https://www.w3schools.com/python/python\_regex.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp)  as an example, right off the bat you can see a very simple straightforward breakdown, and some very basic demonstrations of regex right off the bat (without going into any detail,ignore their table). Thus, now the user knows at least what regex can do, and they will read further if they wish to use the tool.   


To add on to the introduction, I believe most people just don't know *what* regex is capable of. And again since your book is formatted similar to a doc, I still wouldn't get to know *what* regex can do, without reading at least 20+ pages. I think it'd be nice to have a section (could be the intro) that actually goes through 1 simple example that summerizes the idea of each section in your book (again like the above link, search, find, split, etc.), and maybe a hyperlink that jumps to that section. But this is just a personal preference, I'd like to see what the book can offer right off the bat, otherwise I probably won't go too into it. And, it'll be easy for me to look back if I ever forget (I forgot what re.search does, right in the intro there is a hyperlink I can click to jump to it0.   


Regardless, I think it's great, and I've personally bookmarked it. Thank you!",2020-07-07 20:37:39

ng3nq0,gyoxpit,TabulateJarl8,"It really does depend on what you want to do, but I'll give you a list of some of my personal favorites as well as the ones that I use a lot. (Includes standard library modules and stuff from PyPI)

 - `os`/`shutil` - The `os` and `shutil` modules are both built in, and they are super useful. The `os` module basically provides a bunch of interfaces to your operating system; you can get the name, environment variables, work with paths, and do stuff with files and directories. The `shutil` module is a bit smaller, as it just contains a bunch of high-level file operations, like recursive copying/removing, an implementation of the Unix `which` command, and an implementation of `chown`.

 - `re` - I might be a little bit insane, but I really like regular expressions. The `re` module allows you to work with regular expressions, and it can be super powerful. Regular expressions can be super confusing, but like everything, you learn over time. Useful tip: you can comment regular expressions in Python, which is really nice.

 - `flask` - This is the first module from PyPI. Flask is a backend web framework written in Python. If you are good at Python and want to do backend, Flask is super powerful and really good for beginners. Another thing, if you're working with bigger projects with big databases, you could also look at `django`, just its really just preference.

 - `configparser` - Going back to stuff in the standard library, we have `configparser`. ConfigParser allows you to read/write to `.ini` files, allowing you to easily save user preferences for your program. It's super easy to use so I like it a lot.

 - `decimal` - This one can be super helpful. Have you ever tried to do math in Python and it is almost correct but slightly off, causing hours of debugging with no avail? That's because of something called ""Floating Point Precision Errors,"" and it's in most programming languages. Because of the way that computers add numbers with binary, when you do arithmetic on floats, things tend to break. For example, open up the Python interpreter and try running `1.1 * 3`. You should get something like `3.3000000000000003`. The `decimal` module can allow you to fix this. After importing `Decimal` from the `decimal` module, try running `Decimal(""1.1"") * Decimal(""3"")` and see what happens, it should be the correct answer now.

 -  `requests` - `requests` is a module from PyPI, and it is incredibly helpful. `requests` allows you to, well, send HTTP requests for one thing. You could do this with the builtin `urllib` module, but requests has more features and is so much easier to use. 

 - `argparse` - This one is built in, and it allows you to easily create command-line utilities. `argparse` will let you create different types of arguments, which can then be fed into your program to produce a result.

 - `PyQt5` - Interested in making GUIs but Tk isn't your favorite? Me too. I don't really create GUIs too often, but when I do, I like to use PyQt5. PyQt5 allows you to create Qt applications, and it is probably one of the most powerful GUI modules in Python. It comes with a ton of different widgets, and it's super easy to do stuff like multithreading with it. I personally like to use Qt Designer to create the GUIs, and then I use `pyuic5` to convert the `.ui` files to `PyQt5` code.

 - `colorama` - `colorama` allows you to easily add color to your command-line programs. Thats basically it.

 - `json` - The `json` module allows you to parse `json` into a Python dictionary, and then write a Python dictionary into JSON. Useful when paired with `requests` for getting API data, and just a useful module to know about in general.

 - `rich` - Rich allows you to create really nice looking console output, you can make errors look nice, render markdown, progress bars, and a ton of other stuff. It has support for 4-bit color, 8-bit color, Truecolor, and Dumb Terminals. I would really recommend checking it out.

 - `numpy` - NumPy is really good if you need to handle large amounts of data. NumPy also provides high-level mathematical functions to operate on these large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. Since a lot of it is written in C, it is super fast, and the only downside really is that the arrays are stored completely in memory, so it's pretty easy to run out.

**By popular demand:**

 - `itertools` - Itertools it's definitely an extremely useful module. It is used for creating iterators in a really easy way. For example, you can get all possible combinations of length `x` of two lists, get all the possible permutations of an iterable, and other really useful things. I should probably look more into this module myself.

In conclusion, there are a lot of different modules, and these are definitely not all of the useful ones, or even all of the ones that I use, but I figured that those are some nice modules to at least give you inspiration. You could also check out my GitHub for inspiration, if you wanted, and I have a few Python modules myself. I'll link my GitHub and some projects of note below, as well as all of the projects I mentioned in this comment.

ng3nq0,gyp808t,Unbelievr,"Being aware of what's inside the standard library of modules, will surely help you down the road. Have a quick browse and see what's there.

The most useful built-in ones, that are useful to nearly all aspects of Python, are `itertools` and `collections`. To some extent `functools` and `dataclasses` also, though they are not super useful immediately, but very useful to know about.

- `itertools` provides advanced ways to combine, slice, flatten and group iterables and cycles. The `product()` function is very powerful, and can often replace nested for-loops in a compact way.
- `functools` contains decorators that help you easily create classes that can be sorted, memoize functions, etc. There are many videos on how to utilize dataclasses and functools to create easy, maintainable, and powerful objects with ordering.
- `collections` contains a plethora of useful utility tools. It has the `Counter` class, that can wrap an iterable and count the amount of each element, and return the top N most common items. It also provides `defaultdict`, which is a dictionary where unknown keys will have a specified default value. Saves you from writing code to check existence and initialize. Finally the `deque` object is a wrapper around a list, that supports lightning fast appends and pops, and the ability to rotate the lists.

For real-life scenarios, you'll quickly run into `requests` whenever you need to do interact with some website. It's a third-party plugin that builds on top of urllib, and removes the need for tons of boilerplate code. The `os` module will also be your way for interacting with the file system, together with `pathlib` and `glob` in some scenarios.",2021-05-19 14:26:09
ng3nq0,gyq9og6,spez_edits_thedonald,"One thing I should have done sooner was learn to take advantage of python's built-in libraries, rather than implementing things myself because I didn't know about them. 

For example, if you have a list of integers, and you want to obtain their counts, you could build something yourself, or just: 

    >>> import random
    >>> from collections import Counter
    >>>
    >>> x = [random.randint(0, 10) for i in range(20)]
    >>> x
    [0, 4, 8, 10, 7, 5, 9, 10, 2, 6, 7, 2, 0, 10, 9, 1, 8, 10, 7, 0]
    >>>
    >>> counts = Counter(x)
    >>> counts
    Counter({10: 4, 0: 3, 7: 3, 8: 2, 9: 2, 2: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 1: 1})
    >>> counts[0]
    3
    >>> counts[9]

the built-ins usually perform better than what I would have built, `itertools` is another good one, powerful stuff",2021-05-19 18:46:43
ng3nq0,gyp8hje,gmorf33,"Like others have noted, it really depends on what you need to do.   For generic recommendations, I'd say learn `os`, `path`, `datetime`, `shutil`, and `logging`.   These will give you a lot of power scripting on your local machine and interacting with the OS and local file system.

Me personally, most of my programming work involves integrations between systems and moving/manipulating files of various formats, or delivering data to a 3rd party.   For me, these libraries are must-haves:  
`requests` - anything HTTP, really useful for web API's.  
`paramiko` - a really good SFTP library.  
`ElementTree` or `lxml` - working with XML files.  
`json` - most API's use JSON data   
`csv` or `pandas` - working with delimited text data.  
`glob` - great for using wildcard pattern matching for filenames.  
`re` - regular expressions; invaluable when needing to do certain manipulation of data or extracting odd-ball pieces of data from files.  
`smtplib` - sending emails.  A lot of my automations and integrations use this for notifications or generating tickets.",2021-05-19 14:29:33
ng3nq0,gype7u6,xelf,"I posted something similar on this topic a while back:

1) Make sure you understand all the basic data structures, looping and flow control, have you mastered all the stuff here https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/ ?

2) Make sure you have a solid grasp of list/set/dict/generator comprehensions, ternary expressions, generator functions, lambda functions, and slicing.

3) Start working your way though the more popular libraries:

Start with the [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) especially collections, itertools, statistics,  and functools, and then start pulling in things like numpy and pandas, before you start expanding into stuff that specializes in your area of expertise.

|math|numpy|socket|
|sys (exit)|pandas|requests|
|datetime|tkinter|openpyxl|
|string|keyboard|django |
|pygame/turtle|statistics|flask |
|copy|csv|matplotlib |

in1gv6,g44wg5p,that1guy15,"I have been in the IT industry for almost 20 years now. Most of my career was in Infrastructure and data center networking. About 5 years ago I made a hard shift into automation and development. 

As I grew in my networking career I became stronger and stronger at problem solving and figured it would carry over to other areas of IT. Not so much...

We forget the struggles of the entry level engineer in our field pretty quickly. It wasn't until I went through it again that I realized how hard it is. Very humbling.

Documentation and googling/research is 10x harder for entry level as they have no idea what they are looking for and what the correct terms to use in their search. I can craft a detailed search for complex routing topics and almost always have an answer in two clicks. For pytest I can search for hours on how to use a basic feature without any progress. 

Technical documentation has an assumed level of knowledge and few are good at catering to entry level.

With all that said, there is a balance you need to help your teammates with. Yes it's valuable for them to learn how to figure out a problem on their own, but you also need to mentor and help just as much. This is what we expect from leaders and our peers for our own growth. 

Learn to recognize when they are over their head and making no progress. Learn to recognize when they are defeated and lost. They might not know they are (they are learning this too) but this is when you step in. 

Teaching and mentoring does not have to come from Sr level roles. 9 times out of 10 someone is more receptive to someone right above their skill level than a highly skilled Sr engineer. That is because they relate more to you then them.",2020-09-05 15:48:04
in1gv6,g45h30s,ELIMINADO,"> As an intermediate programmer I find that many of my problems can easily be solved by just googling the problem

Forgive my snark, but congratulations, you're no longer able to empathise with a complete novice.

I'm very new to programming myself, and my primary issue is understanding how to word the problem that is causing me issues. How can I ""google the problem"" if I don't know exactly what the problem is? Sometimes there are obvious cases where i.e. I receive an error message and can google that, but other times I might be having problems with control flow/logic and it isn't immediately obvious what the solution is. 

I spent half a day last week trying to figure out why I couldn't get some code to count instances of a word in a list of strings. I thought I'd tried everything, I'd used the count function and failed to get it working with the way I'd structured my code, I thought my problem was due to control flow in my loops, I just wasn't able to get the output I wanted. When I searched online for answers, the results directed me to Regex and importing modules from libraries.

I asked a question here and it turned out to be a simple error with an implementation of my ""occurrence counter"" combined with a flawed understanding of membership operators. About two minutes after posting a question, a nice person replied saying (x won't work, it does y. Count() will work if you use z). With that insight, I corrected my approach in about 30 seconds and the code worked the first time I ran it.

Eight hours of head-banging frustration. Obviously the onus is on me to try and ensure I understand what the hell I'm studying, but the end result is I spent many hours searching for a solution to a misidentified problem.",2020-09-05 18:39:53

In some cases I just literally pasted the question and added ""python"" at the end... no need for fancy knowledge on how google finds stuff.

Same with many of my own issues. I remember one of my first ""big"" issues was that I needed to minimize a function with respect to multiple dimensions. Just googling ""two dimension minimization python"" and browsing through the results gave me the answer. Back then it took me some time to recognize the most adequate solution, but that time isn't wasted if in the end you lear something.

in1gv6,g44v4xt,developernexus,"Searching the Internet for answers is a wonderful researching tool. However, I would make the claim that it often pales in comparison to getting direct help from those experienced with the program. This, in my opinion, is because the Internet answers often give only a very narrow ""slice of the pie"" - - with the focus most often being on providing the solution rather than teaching the use of a tool.

From personal experiences, I've been self-taught in the majority of my sysadmin and developer work, with university only really giving the foundation needed. It wasn't until I joined a workplace that I realized how my knowledge was full of gaps... Because I would usually get solutions from the Internet or trial-and-error. The experienced members on my team helped fill in those gaps with better methods of doing the same thing, how to stay aware of security and performance, tools and resources I had never heard of before, and general best practices.

It's why I always applaud the wonderful Internet folk that go above and beyond in their answers, explaining not just the how... But the why, when, and where as well.

So I started modifying it to add things, and breaking it. I spent more time coding the bot than playing the game. I gave away server time for groups so I could mine data (I still feel dirty). I started with basic knowledge and now have a *decently* working full fledged tracker that -

* records log on/log off time
* tracks steamid, viking, connected status, how long they've played
* death tracker
* help page for the bot commands
* bot commands for last online, players connected, time played, deaths, 12/24/weekly player count graph
* an eviction checker for players not online for 5 days
* restart server, update server bot commands
* various bot commands to modify back end db
* magic 8 ball, yes/no, and coin flip bot commands just because

I started with migrating the csv to MySQL using pandas to read and mysql for writes. It sort of worked but I was chasing crazy bugs because I had no idea what I was doing. Spent a lot of time getting help in the Python discord channel, having discussions, lurking, and figuring out what I needed to learn next. Pandas basics - check. 

After a lot of hardship, I found the random bug problem. The main loop was an async function and all my functions were sync. WTF is async? So I learn about async functions and loops. Converted sync functions to async and it worked better, but MySQL doesn't support async. *await* Find a sqlite library that supports async. *await* Convert MySQL queries to sqlite. I learn db basics during all this.

I'm still learning. I'm still chasing bugs and random errors. I'm working on a log emulator with a graphical interface so I can trigger specific messages for testing. Now I'm learning django so I can build a web app to do this. I got the debugger set up to actually step through code and change variables, and I have a good reason to do it besides following another tutorial.

The more I learn, the more I connect the dots, and the light bulbs come on like a Griswald Christmas movie.

Find a project that inspires you, poke around on git, brain storm, fork someones idea because you can make it better, solve a problem that doesn't need to be solved.

I wrote all this simply because no one in my life can grasp the feeling of accomplishment it is to have a working program that is actually useful in some way. r/learnpython is a constant inspiration and will teach you the basic from just lurking, and I can't thank the folks on the python discord enough. Any tough problem I had, someone was willing to help correct code or give advice on the spot. It's a great place to ask questions or get leads on things you might not know yet. 

So OP is correct, get to coding to solve a problem. Now I'm integrating programming into my professional life slowly, just simple data analysis for now (thanks pandas), but it's like being the excel wiz in the office only better.",2022-03-11 01:54:15

I can tell you for certain there is one thing that will help you get up to speed and be a productive programmer more than anything else. 

First a story.

I am not a sports fan. I do not enjoy watching sports at all. I do not like to watch them on TV or in person. I have seen major local franchises win it all and it did not effect me in any way. I have tried to make myself care, I do not care. I can not care, it isn't in me. It would benefit me greatly if I liked sports. I could bond with other humans, maybe make some friends, certainly have things to talk to others about. ""Boy he really knows his sports"" is something nobody has ever said about me. I would LOVE to be a sports fan, it looks like a lot of fun. I had long since let that dream go when I heard a piece of advice from none other than Artie Lange.

Artie said, and I'm paraphrasing here, something like this:

""Here is how you become interested in sports. Let's say you have $1,000 to your name. It's 100% of the money you have in the world. Now, go down to your local bookie and put $5,000 on the next game. You'll learn everything there is to know about that sport in one game and you won't miss a play.""

What he is saying is simple: to become interested in something you need to have incentive. That's how you get started, you have incentive. How you keep going is you get good at it. Why? Because we enjoy things we are good at. Who enjoys things they are not good at? Nobody. The problem is when you start something new, you are not good, so it is not fun, ergo: you need incentive.

You want to be a Python programmer, but you do not know where to start? Eh, I don't buy that. Google ""I want to be a python programmer but I do not know where to start"" and you will find some place to start. That's not the problem. 

Your problem is twofold:

1. You do not have incentive.
2. You are not good at programming so it is not fun.

You really can not do #2 without #1, so let's focus on #1. Incentive.

This is going to be something you decide. Think about a simple (can't stress that enough) program that would make your life easier. Something you could run that would do some calculation or do some task that would be fun or useful to have. Don't worry about execution yet, just decide to write something that YOU need. You, personally. Now, open up a new word doc and write down, in plain english what that would be. Keep it simple. Do not add a ton of features right now, in fact, try to make it as simple as possible, but, something that is still useful. If you need to send yourself an email at 3pm every day that tells you the weather tomorrow, don't go adding in all kinds of colors and graphics in that email. That email should say:

    Red Maxx tomorrow it is going to be cold and snowy with a high of 32 and a low of 20.

No colors, no links, nothing fancy. It will do the one simple thing you wanted it to do.

NOTE: If you are not excited by this piece of software you are planning to write, start over and pick something else.

Now, you've picked the thing you want to write.

You will be amazed at how fast obstacles fall away. You will surprise yourself with the sheer amount and type of code you write in a short time. When you look at your code from a month ago you will wonder how you were ever that dumb. This is the path to becoming a good programmer.

Once you are a good programmer you will be having a lot of fun and the amount of personal excitement and interest you need will give way to something else: intellectual curiosity. 

You see, I tricked you a bit there. Not only were you getting good and having fun, you were also being exposed to new things in your language of choice (Python) and you will start to broaden your knowledge of what is POSSIBLE. That alone will keep you rolling on new, esoteric, interesting projects.

Don't believe me?

Buddy an entire ecosystem of code has been built this way, it's called 'open source software'. 

Do you think for a minute all those nerds writing all that code weren't learning and becoming interested? 

The servers that are running the website we are chatting right now were built because nerds were simply interested in IF they could do something.

Believe me once you are rolling, you are going to wonder how you ever did anything else.

The 3rd and final piece of advice I will give you is this: If you want to solidify your knowledge in your own mind and in a very formal way, teach Python to someone else. That will lock concepts into your brain in a way that nothing else will.

Godspeed and good luck.",2021-02-02 18:28:51

Take a few of your spouse's favorite books, poems, songs, or anything else you think they'd like to experience more than once, and make high-quality recordings of yourself singing / reading them aloud. They won't hear your voice for everyday tasks, but they'll still get to enjoy listening to it whenever they want, and in a much more natural format than programmatic text-to-speech. Be sure to use high-quality recording hardware and settings, and aggressively back up the files you save (e.g. keep it locally, send a copy on a USB key to a sibling in another state, and save a copy with a cloud storage provider like google drive).

As for the actual text-to-speech problem, I don't know where I'd begin, but I do know that even state-of-the-art commercial solutions today sound pretty robotic. This is likely to improve in the future, however, so it would still be worth saving some high-quality recordings of whatever the reference phrases are that they use to match voices today.

o7kvjp,h2zm58q,LingStuffs,"Similar to what others have said, there are a load of commercial services that might be more optimal for this task. Text-to-Speech technology for voice replication is used a lot for silent speech synthesis, which is speech synthesis technology for people who have lost the capacity to speak from things such as damage or removal of elements from the vocal tract.

Handily the big problem these days is more to do with interfacing with such individuals so that they can produce speech without typing and reducing latency, rather than overcoming large issues in synthesis. You'll still find modern speech synthesis solutions lack some of the nuances of prosody and intonation, as well as difficulties producing out of vocabulary (OOV) words accurately such as names and places but overall the technology is very respectable and authentic. Handily a lot of these companies provide free demos so you can see what your voice would sound like ingested into their systems. I'd give that a go and see if it's in the ballpark of what you're after :)

You can also go the hands on route with Python if you're up for the challenge, again just Google open-source voice cloning in Python. It's unlikely you're going to encounter the same quality as a commercial product but that does come with the benefit of physically owning the model. A potential worry using a commercial API is that should the company fold, there's not necessarily going to be a guarantee that the model used to replicate your speech signals doesn't get deleted or otherwise lost.

Either way I hope you find what you're looking for! :)",2021-06-25 12:39:11
o7kvjp,h2zvzkt,Retropunch,"Unfortunately the tech isn't really there to do it as well as you might like (although it's close). Especially with rolling your own, you probably won't get the results you're looking for at the moment.

For future proofing, I'd suggest you get some really high quality recordings (as in, not on your phone or a computer mic) of your voice saying a very large selection of texts in different tones/emotions/etc. I believe there is standard voice synthesis text which covers each phoneme, but I can't find it at the moment. 

This can then be used when the tech catches up - which I'd imagine would only be 10 years or so.",2021-06-25 14:06:42

I read an article, once, where the writer pointed out that stackoverflow doesn’t actually exist “to answer questions”, per se.

Let me expand with my own experience. My first posts often received blunt answers or were flagged as duplicates or off-topic. This was quite frustrating, but it \*really\* helped me in two key areas: searching for information and asking good questions. The first you will develop over time. The second really is just making sure your question is in line with the site guidelines, making sure you've got a minimal example in code, and a clear result in mind among other things. In my experience people are rather responsive towards questions that show effort, and often by going through that effort I find that I never needed to post a question in the first place, as I found the solution myself.

So remember, SO is not an umbrella programming help forum. Since joining I've noticed r/LearnPython to be much more appropriate for open-ended questions. There are also other Stack Exchange sites that you might be interested in, like Software Engineering or Code Review to name a few. I'm sorry if you've encountered some, let's say, less-than-helpful people, though. Trolling is never the right way to go, but don't discount SO's value just because it won't completely bend to your will. It is a wonderful resource and you should probably learn how to use it.

2. How-To/Learn-To: These types of books teach me topics enough to be able to practice/utilize the technology. Obviously, there are a lot of this type of books on computer-related topics, not sure if the same for other fields.
3. Textbooks: these are academic books used in Universities etc. with theories.

hah264,fv43alh,magestooge,">Although it took me almost 4 hours for only 25 lines of code

And you know what? You could probably do it with 20 lines of code in 6 hours.

Line count has nothing to do with the quality of the code and should not be used as a parameter to judge your code. Neither a large number of lines, nor too small a number of lines are good. What matters is that your code should be clear, concise, and efficient. There are often multiple ways of writing a piece of code.

    x = []
    for i in some_list:
        x.append(i)

AND `x = [i for i in some_list]`do the same thing. Here the lower line count is better.

But if you are comparing the following two:

`x = sum([(((j** 2) * some_list[i]) x 3 ** some_other_list[i])/j for i, j in enumerate(a_list)])`

    x = 0
    for i, j in enumerate(a_list):
        num1 = some_list[i]
        num2 = some_other_list[i]
        res = (j**2 * num1) * (3 ** num2)
        x += res/j

I think many people will agree that the second would be better.

So how many lines you use depends on what kind of problem you are solving. And whether you are able to strike a balance between using up lines unnecessarily vs. keeping your code clean and readable.

P.S.: The second block of code doesn't do anything specific, it's just a random example.",2020-06-17 11:41:41

I'll show you some code I made while learning if it'll help spark any ideas. You can definitely do it.  
  
What I wrote is not as precise as using regex since I was mostly adding to a lesson in Crash Course, but it could push you in the right direction. For example this won't account for specific text or be able to differentiate or leave out specific lines, but rather count *every* single word in a text file. But some regular expressions could easily be adapted to it I'm sure.    
  
All of the word count results are printed in the console, but you could easily take self.word_count results each time and write/append it to another file or spreadsheet in that same for loop inside of folder_loop().

- How did you identify this problem could be automated?
- Do you feel the program would need maintenance/updates why or why not?

- You chose to use X package. Why?

Just be honest and keep cool, best of luck !",2020-05-13 11:31:46

gix1qt,fqhbljc,Expo9771,"Congrats! automation is a great career opportunity, I am a business/ cs major that stumbled into a career of python automation.    I have started to do a lot of demos and what I find works best is focusing less on code and more about results.   Python is easy to learn but for someone who has not started yet it looks like black magic so I never bother to show my script more than a quick video.   I focus on a comparison of the output vs the old manual process.   I also like to talk about where it can be further applied.  Python can do a lot and I am willing to beat 80% of what you learned/ coded can be used else where to save more time.",2020-05-13 12:35:53
gix1qt,fqhbyg8,ELIMINADO,"To answer your immediate question, yes, show the packages you used, as well as be ready to explain anything that can be remotely construed as an info sec risk (anything that reached outside the network, for example). You're right to show some time study that explains the time efficiencies; managers really care about those things. I'm terms of explaining how the tool works, have a high level overview of how it works, and a detailed flow chart or diagram as a backup. I doubt you'll be doing any in-depth code reviews.

More generally, there's good and bad things that can come from automation. I've automated many tasks in the past and, in my experience, the prospect of cost savings always brings positive and negative attention. I once had a meeting where I showed a tool to some senior managers, and one of them was able to shoot it down because I used NumPy and Pandas, which you have to import with pip. It turned out that this manager wanted to have his team implement the solution themselves. The point is that things can get political when you have ideas such as yours that affect the business's bottom line.

Automating tasks really can be a double-edged sword. Years ago, after I got out of the military and got my first job in the private sector, I automated a task that used to take one person like two weeks to perform and I was able to achieve it in about an hour. The next day, my boss fired me. Keep in mind, this wasn't due to a screw-up on my part; she had concluded some time before that I wasn't a fit for her but was waiting for me to finish that tool before letting me go.

Anyways, best of luck to you in your presentation.",2020-05-13 12:40:02

This led to a lot of push back from the other team members because they would mostly be redundant.

gix1qt,fqhsa8g,Crypt0Nihilist,"CTOs are all about risk. If something goes wrong, they get it in the neck. He's going to be concerned about the security of packages and any data stored, any system load and the impact system changes will have on operations. He won't want you to create something that is massively useful that will fall over as soon as a member of his team tweaks a setting, so he may seek some comfort that that isn't the case.

You need to be mentally prepared that he might not like the idea of some random person writing scripts on his estate, like a guest coming to your house and arranging your books. It is objectively an improvement, but it is an over-reach. I've been in meetings before when a CTO has tried to tear a strip off me because I've done something good, but he thought he should have been involved sooner or has worried I might introduce security risks. It'll probably be fine, but just mentally prepare yourself that you might have to defend yourself. Have a think of how you might convey that the app is very light-touch when it comes to systems interfaces and how it uses widely used and trusted packages. Hopefully it'll all be positive, but I have walked into this kind of a meeting expecting handshakes and a pat on the back, but instead been given a hand-grenade and a knife in the back. 

Don't forget that this is an opportunity for you. If you like doing this, then perhaps you could ask how you could work more closely with him and the devs in the future if you see other opportunities (he'll want early engagement so he can keep an eye on you and participate in any eventual credit) and if he has come across possible use cases elsewhere in the company where you might be able to help.",2020-05-13 15:24:20

> also, please feel free to make suggestions to this program!

* It's a very good practice (as you've done) to put your code inside a function. However, one of the primary reasons for doing this is so your code doesn't run automatically when the file is interpreted. In your case, you call `moveSpecFiles` directly, which means it will run whenever that line is interpreted.

  Instead, ""sentinel"" this call inside an `if __name__ == ""__main__"":` if-statement. This statement will only be true if the file has been called or executed directly--not imported, or in any other manner.

  For example, what if someone was to make a GUI for this script? They couldn't import your code without it executing.

* There are two issues with your constants (`dest`, `src`, `txt_ID`): first, you should avoid posting personal or identifiable information in a public repo. Specifically, this identifies your username as well as the type of machine you are using.

  More importantly, these are what are known as ""magic numbers""--values that have context only outside your program. That is, these values are only meaningful to you, and probably only for a single execution.

  The solution to both these problems is to get these values from the user at runtime. You can do this traditionally with `input()`, or you can make your script take command-line arguments. The `click` package is a good way to do this.

* `dest`, `src`, and `txt_ID` aren't particularly good variable names. The first two are okay, but only because of the length of your program. In longer programs you will be well-served getting into the habit of giving your variables more context. `srt_path` or something similar adds a ton of context. Finally, Python variables should avoid uppercase characters as per PEP8, so `txt_ID` should be `txt_id`, or better, `search_suffix`.

* Do some research on the `pathlib` standard library module. It's the new hotness.

* Avoid `print()` statements in operational code. That is, a function should either: a) do something useful, or b) interact with the user. This goes back to importability, but mostly it just makes your code more re-usable as the important bits don't have side-effects. I would also urge you to consider the `logging` standard module.

* Finally, and this one is *really* minor, but script names should be commands: i.e., `move_files` not `moving_files`, just like function names.",2021-01-29 07:57:42

You'll will almost always learn more than computer science to do something. Whether it's a game or a webapp.

You can definitely master programming.  Mastery of a subject is estimated to take \~10,000 hours  or 5 years of programming 8 hours/day.  So by year 15 (where I am), you've probably hit it.  Mastery doesn't mean you don't ever struggle, but chances are you've probably seen everything at that point.  Picking up a new language and becoming decently competent at it may take as little as 3 days (e.g., when I learned Fortran).

I'm not a programmer by trade.  I'm an aerospace engineer, but I probably hit mastery around year 10.  There was no defined point, but it was never my focus.  Don't beat yourself up over it.  Who cares if it takes another year?

gdjxm9,fphq39b,socal_nerdtastic,"Python has a lot of tricks to help optimize code. One of them is that the integers -5 to 255 are preloaded at boot and treated as singletons. All other integers are created as needed. So 300 is created twice, therefore `is` fails. 200 is simply copied twice from the preload area, so `is` returns True. 

Another trick is that all literals in a single block (eg a line of code in the REPL) are combined, so they are only evaluated once. This means that your code acts differently depending on if it was run on one line or multiple lines: 

    >>> a = 300
    >>> b = 300
    >>> a is b
    False
    >>> a, b = 400, 400
    >>> a is b
    True

You'll see more differences in running in the REPL vs a file.

**Edit**: I see some python beginners feeling overwhelmed at this. DON'T BE. If you take anything away it should be that beginners should always use `==`, and never use `is`.

I think the only exceptions are a few special objects such as `None`, `True` and `False`, of which only one can ever exist.",2020-05-04 23:29:44
gdjxm9,fpj6vmo,port443,"Hey OP, I know you got the answer but no one really showed you ""under the hood"".

Documentation tells you how a function *should* behave, and hopefully its right but people screw up all the time. The code tells the truth!

edit: And for posterity, the answer for Python 3.8 is -5 through 256 are pre-allocated into an array.

For Python 3.8, from ""longobject.c"": https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/longobject.c
    
    PyObject *
    PyLong_FromLong(long ival)
    {
        PyLongObject *v;
        unsigned long abs_ival;
        unsigned long t;  /* unsigned so >> doesn't propagate sign bit */
        int ndigits = 0;
        int sign;
    
        if (IS_SMALL_INT(ival)) {
            return get_small_int((sdigit)ival);
        }

Well we can see immediately, there's a `IS_SMALL_INT` check, and if its `true` the function returns.  
Ultimately, the definitions are found in pycore_interp.h: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Include/internal/pycore_interp.h

    #define IS_SMALL_INT(ival) (-NSMALLNEGINTS <= (ival) && (ival) < NSMALLPOSINTS)
    ...
    #define NSMALLPOSINTS           _PY_NSMALLPOSINTS
    #define NSMALLNEGINTS           _PY_NSMALLNEGINTS
    ....
    #define _PY_NSMALLPOSINTS    257
    #define _PY_NSMALLNEGINTS    5

Ok, everything checks out. The final piece is `get_small_int()` (also from longobject.c):

    static PyObject *
    get_small_int(sdigit ival)
    {
        assert(IS_SMALL_INT(ival));
        PyThreadState *tstate = _PyThreadState_GET();
        PyObject *v = (PyObject*)tstate->interp->small_ints[ival + NSMALLNEGINTS];
        Py_INCREF(v);
        return v;
    }

And this is getting some object from an array called `small_ints`. Well, we can *assume* whats in the array, and tracking it down we find its initialized in `_PyLong_Init` (also in longobject.c):

    int
    _PyLong_Init(PyThreadState *tstate)
    {
    #if NSMALLNEGINTS + NSMALLPOSINTS > 0
        for (Py_ssize_t i=0; i < NSMALLNEGINTS + NSMALLPOSINTS; i++) {
            sdigit ival = (sdigit)i - NSMALLNEGINTS;
            int size = (ival < 0) ? -1 : ((ival == 0) ? 0 : 1);
    
            PyLongObject *v = _PyLong_New(1);
            if (!v) {
                return -1;
            }
    
            Py_SET_SIZE(v, size);
            v->ob_digit[0] = (digit)abs(ival);
    
            tstate->interp->small_ints[i] = v;
        }
    ...

edit: This is looping while `i < 5 + 257`, with `i` starting at 0. It then subtracts 5 from i, and thats how the loop goes. So you wind up with -5 through 256 (since its `<`, not `<=`)

So that's the under-the-hood tour.",2020-05-05 05:59:13

gdjxm9,fpjj8nh,ELIMINADO,"Classic Python gotcha!

Your answer isn't _quite_ right:

> Python caches small integers, which are integers between -5 and 256. 

In fact, Python is not _guaranteed_ to do this - it's nowhere written in the Python spec.  

It turns out that _CPython_, by far the most common implementation of Python, does in fact do this, and has since 2.x days.

But other implementations do not.  In particular, if you use Cython, a way of compiling Python to C for speed (it's not a magic bullet but it's a great way to interface with C or C++), then `is` is _not_ guaranteed to work between integers.

Overall, if `a is b` is true, then `a == b` is true (except if you write your own `__eq__` method and have made a terrible mistake).  So using `a is b` over `a == b` is usually an optimization, and if there's any doubt, don't do it.",2020-05-05 09:22:46
gdjxm9,fpjpfmd,enricojr,"In addition to other commenters pointing out the interpreters optimization of small numbers, I think it's important to also highlight the difference between ""is"" and ""==""

""is"" checks to see if the two variables reference the same object under the hood. In general, if you don't understand what this means you shouldn't be using ""is"".

""=="" checks to see if the two variables have the same value. I'm willing to bet that 8 times out of 10 this is what most people want to do.",2020-05-05 11:09:14

The HARDEST thing for me for years (I've been learning programming since I was 8 and I'm near 40 now and all but 2 semesters in college were self-taught) was learning all the basic stuff - this is how they do variables, this is how you print to screen, but struggling with something to do with it other than a Tetris clone or Word processor. Nowadays with books like Dive Into Python, Automate the Boring Stuff, and Impractical Python (and probably similar books in other languages?) you get more of an idea of the types of projects you can do. At this point, I've got a GOOD handful of Python projects that solve REAL problems for me (and sometimes also for others!). I even got to contribute to someone else's large project a few months back. That has made all the difference for me in having the motivation to keep going.

Projects I've done to solve problems for myself:

* A program that used the flickr API to help me add photos to groups. Slightly more detailed: I was participating in groups that had a gate like: 25 views. Once you got to the next gate 50 views, you were supposed to remove your photo and move it to the next group. So I wrote a program to automate that.
* A GUI program (used by others - who have filed bugs and made feature requests) - to track donations to the Extra Life event and produce files that allow the results to be used on screen while streaming
* A program that uses MQTT to let me know if I've left my garage door open after dark
* a program to track how close I am to finishing my mortgage (considering that I'm making randomly sized extra payments)
* a program to handle my btrfs snapshots and back them up to a server
* a program to create math programs for my kids to solve
* a program to go through my photos and produce graphs of which cameras and which lenses I used

I really enjoyed programming but feel like I'm to old to change tracks and learn Python, put it to use and get a job coding with it. I just wonder if I would be wasting my time. Programming is fun, it's what I like to do and Python rocks. Any suggestions, comments?",2020-07-10 20:41:55

* Name your functions something that a human understands.  `Rh` means nothing to me and the python interpreter doesn't care if a function is called `DKLSjkjlj_dkdjsi83k` or `download_all_saved_posts`.  One name is quickly understood, the other is not.
* Use the `contextmanager` method of opening files: it requires fewer lines of code and makes sure that you don't forget to close a file.  In case you weren't familiar with it:  change line `132` to `with open(file_name, 'a', encoding=""utf-8"") as f` and move lines lines 133-154 over 4 spaces.
* Windows is a PITA for escaping filenames, as you can end up with far too many `\` characters.  Prefex your strings with `r` and it'll use that string literally, so you can just put in the actual path, without having to escape everything.
* Checkout the `pathlib` library, instead of `os.path`.  It's pretty dope.

Gaming Example of where you might use a class:

Some people want to make games, and they find that it is interesting when they learn to make ""objects"" that not only hold data, but can act on data as well. For example, maybe they get a ""sword"" that ""slices"", a ""shield"" that ""bashes"", a ""cloak"" that ""heals"". Maybe they want to sell the cloak and buy a set of armor that increases their protection when they wear it and reduces their protection when they take it off. Maybe they want to sell the sword and buy a warhammer that bashes like the shield. Maybe they want to sell the shield and buy a second sword or warhammer for dual-wielding. These combinations quickly become overwhelming in a function-based program, but similar behavior ""evolves"" in an object-oriented environment without a lot of additional fanfare.

Business Example of where you might use a class:

Maybe you want a logging object that can be passed around and used by various subroutines the way that a lesser programmer might use the ""print"" statement. This can easily be done with some sort of logging object. A subroutine tells the object the log statement, the log file, the urgency, and whether to use a sortable, human-readable, or machine-readable datetime stamp. The object, upon receiving this information does its own thing: opens the log file for writing, builds a string that includes the datetime stamp, urgency, and log statement together, appends it to the end of the open log file, flushes the cache, and closes the log file. Bingo, bango, bongo, you just created a logging system that's not much harder to use than a print statement.

kfmwsx,gg9cg0n,mojo_jojo_reigns,"I use classes in my selenium automations. Since I use selenium to automate things on different websites, each which demands their own individual workflows, I built 2 classes. One sets up my driver, with init conditions (such as the download directory, whether to run headless, etc). The other carries the methods I've developed as shorthand for much longer sequences in selenium. I then keep each website's automations in its own file and import both classes. Since many of these webpages have different areas that work differently, I organize my methods and individual variables (like field ids) into one class per area and that class inherits the methods from my selenium tools class and inits using the driver OR inherits the driver from another class in the same file.

Before this, I had no good use-cases for classes. Method inheritance and the ability to pass a driver so I don't have to explicitly call it are my reasons for using them now.",2020-12-18 15:39:57

But it's by no means bad to never *define* a class yourself (you use them all the time in Python btw, it's a notable difference). Classes are just one of the many tools available to you, they are not required to be used, only you could maybe use them in some cases to improve your code.",2020-12-18 15:16:15
kfmwsx,gg9fssg,Cdog536,"No you don’t have to define them if you don’t need to use them for anything. I am just starting to get into classes after about 8-9 months of Python. I am only using them as a data scientist because I want to create useful modules that I can load into multiple scripts (a lot of methods I make are defined so I can repetitively use functions without having to copy and paste code into scripts). Other than that, they aren’t necessary. 

However, using them can be a great benefit to yourself to make you a much better programmer in general. Defining classes helps you touch the waters of Object Oriented Programming, learn how to generalize your processes, learn how to create useful architecture in your scripts, and help you get into the nasty bugs surrounding data types. 

First, become comfortable making functions. Then, when you make more complex functions that are messy or are making so many functions in a script, I would then suggest you move onto classes for organization. I suggest using classes when you are creating a function that does a lot and you want to expand the function. This is a good way to introduce yourself into their usefulness and see their application. There are great 1-2 hour tutorials on youtube to gain a footing into classes. The rest can be self-taught through experimentation.

TL;DR - it’s good to know what they are. Use them when you are working on a project that benefits from it. They can be tricky and hard to make at first, but overall make you a much better programmer. The best scripts they will be used on are ones you will revisit and refine very very often (they can make your life a bit easier and they are very satisfying to develop and figure out). It will take hours to implement at first, but will take less time the second time you make classes and so forth. In the long run, being an Object Oriented Programmer will help your career in programming - regarding efficiency and architectural development. Think of class creation as being someone who creates useful toolboxes for programming.",2020-12-18 16:07:54
kfmwsx,gg9cwfs,ttirol,"I was the same. Knew Python was an Object-Oriented language, but just didn't see what classes were needed for, but now I understand more after having learned Java, another OOP language.

Classes aren't objects (they're *classes* of objects) but for this explanation I'll use them interchangeably. The reason you want to use objects is 1) to allow them to solve their own problems with their own code written in their own source file separate from the program you may be writing currently, 2) they can allow you to re-use code and save time and 3) they can allow you to use similar operations with the same name on different classes of objects (polymorphism).

1) whenever you use a method (object.do_something()) you're just using code that's part of that object. You don't even need to know how that method does what it does, and you don't have to write it yourself in your script, you just use code that's associated with that object that will know best how to solve that problem for that object.

2) you can *implement* functionality from existing object classes, effectively re-using code that is already written. This saves time, but perhaps more importantly it ensures that Object B works the same as Object A if B is a subclass of A. When you make subclasses you know that A methods are part of subclass B, and can be used on objects of both class A and class B (although you can make them do different things if you want). The consistency is what is important here.

3) This one is hard to explain from mobile without a code example, but consider this: you have a class called Employee, and all employees get paid, so all employees can have a method called get-salary() that will return the number of dollars they make per year. Not all employees are executives though so not all employees do executive tasks. So you make a *class* called Executive to handle the behaviour of executives. The executive class implements Employee class as a subclass of Employee class. Therefore executive class has the Employee.get_salary() method. The Executive class can have methods specific to executives like set_strategy(), that other employees who aren't executives don't have because they don't set the company's strategy. Also, not all employees are engineers and only engineers do engineer things. So you can have an Engineer class that's a subclass of Employee, that has get_salary() because engineers have salaries like all employees, but that also has its own engineering methods like make_blueprints(). Salespeople get paid differently so their get_salary() method can be a *variation* of the Employee get_salary() method, where you *override* the original Employee method to incorporate a calculation for commission on sales by that specific salesperson. As long as the method name stays the same, any outside program calling get_salary() on Salesperson won't know or care the difference. Say you have this for all types of employees, with many subclasses of Employee for each employee type. Then you come along and want to list all of their salaries. Guess what, it doesn't matter what kind of employee they are to the code that's listing their salaries, when you can just call get_salary() on any employee of any type. You don't need to write more code, it just uses the code you wrote *once* in the Employee class, regardless of employee or type. That code that gets salary is *encapsulated* in each employee object, you don't need to care how it's processed at the time of listing all salaries, it just works.

Well you can create a class called enemies and within that class you can define different attributes for the enemies. 

Now anytime you need an enemy in your game. you can create as many as you want by calling the enemy object. You could create hundreds of enemies with a simple for loop and storing the objects in a list. All in 1 line of code.",2020-12-18 15:48:34
kfmwsx,gg9gfqv,underground_miner,"I look at a class like a mini-program. It is self-contained and easy to reuse in its specific context (the key is specific context).

To me it makes it easier to reason about the code when large parts of it are encapsulated (hidden) within a class.

For example, you can write a game using bare geometry, lines, line segments, rays, circles, etc.... It would be difficult to maintain and change. It would be much easier to work with a ""circle"" where you could set its center and radius. It would also be pretty cool if you could add a vector to the circle to move it around in your world. The nuts and bolts of the math to accomplish this would be hidden by the objects. You would see new_circle = circle + vector. 

This is where the power of classes comes from. Hiding detail so you can work at a higher level.

Well the following is a monthly task i do for work, hoping this can be automated somehow.

Once a month, for a span of 2 days (if done full time), I have to do exclusion searches on TWO different websites. I have a list of names (around 600) that i copy paste, to the search bar. 

I figured out how to not use the mouse anymore for a faster process (alt +left arrow) and then (alt+tab) but the task is so tedious (copying from excel to pasting in search bar). Once i hit enter, the results pop up and i have to save it as a PDF (Ctrl+P) and name the file with the persons ID and then their name.

Basically manually entering and saving 1200 pdf files is so tedious that it makes me fall behind on my other tasks. Hoping theres a way around this.

>>>

[My first edit on a post: Many questions so I'll try my best to answer them here in one go. 

I've been doing this task for 2 months after a coworker, who did this before, resigned. Reasons for these gov't exclusion searches are for monthly compliance (healthcare field) and for liability (Only I'm accountable if i screw up) also the company is growing -> more peeps to monitor. We do have a software team but they're stretched thin (constant urgent projects) so I (22F) started to dabble into CS and software programming (not just for work but also as a hobby).

 My original plan was to automate this task myself (I'm currently in section 4 in Automate the Boring Stuff with Py.) but realize this needs to be automated asap after the first month doing it(but i lack the skills). Boss is pretty chill,but if i do get more tasks I honestly prefer that then doing this (more tasks->more experience).

i2xpkq,g07zfje,Allanon001,"One thing that stood out to me is your list comprehension statements,  you use the _ character to represent a variable and that character is usually used to show the variable is not used.  For example:

    random_numbers = [randint(0,100) for _ in range(1000)]

If you are going to actually use the variable then I would suggest changing _ to x.",2020-08-03 16:08:00
i2xpkq,g08201u,zanfar,"General Notes:

* You should move your check-for-spaces conditional into your list comprehension. Additionally, as /u/Allanon001 said, don't use `_` to store data you use. `_` is usually Pythonic for ""don't care"".
* When you check to see if the character is in your dictionary, use an `else` instead of a second `if`.
* I'm not sure why your catching `KeyError` if you check for its existence inside your `try:` block.
* I don't really see the need for your `MorseFunctions` class-you don't ever use it as such and it has no instance or class data. I would put the functions directly in your module. Also, if you keep it this way, those functions should be `staticmethods` as they don't rely on instance or class data.
* `MorseGUI` shouldn't depend on outside data: pass `root` into your initialization function and store it in self. This way you're code isn't tied to globals or variable naming.
* You shouldn't use `self.` variables without initializing them in `__init__`. What happens if someone creates a `MorseGUI` object but *doesn't* call `run_program`? Set them to `None` in `__init__` and check their value before you use them.
* `available_text` and `morse_list` should probably live in the module, not the GUI file, although I don't see where they're used at all",2020-08-03 16:23:44
i2xpkq,g080394,j03,"Nice work! I had no idea that Morse went beyond A-Z 0-9. Since you've asked for comments, here are a few around the encoding/decoding of the Morse:

&#x200B;

* I personally wouldn't bother with the `MorseFunctions` class --  the class doesn't deal with state, and there are no obvious cases where you'd benefit from inheritance. If you were set on using a class, then you may as well decorate them with `@staticmethod` to avoid having to instantiate an instance of `MorseFunctions`... but really, a class isn't needed her.
* On line 17 of `MorseFunctions` you use a list comprehension to convert the string to a list of characters. You can just do `message_split = list(message.upper())` rather than the `_ for _ in xyz` stuff.  However, you could swap out L17-19 with: `[c for c in message.upper() if c != "" ""]` to achieve both the listification and the space removal.. Alternatively you could do `[c or c in message.upper().replace("" "", """")]`. The latter is faster, but arguably less readable. Maybe `[c.upper() for c in message.replace("" "", """")]` would be a good compromise? But thinking about it more -- why do you even need to convert it to a list? `message_split = message.upper().replace("" "", """")` would work, since strings behave broadly like lists anyway.
* Rather than having the try/catch loop on L23-30, you could make use of the `.get()` method present on dictionaries. `.get(<key>)` returns the value associated with the given key, with an option default value in case the key doesn't exist. This would look something like: `encoded_message = [morse_codes.get(c, '#') for c in message_split]`.",2020-08-03 16:12:03

i9kwe1,g1fpd81,daemonbreaker,"First, I think its awesome that beginners are taking security seriously.

To get the easy question out of the way - it's pretty safe to assume that the default libraries aren't malicious. These are maintained as part of the core python open source project, and getting malware past that review process would be extremely difficult.

As for other modules... there is a (pretty small) chance that some may be malicious. And unfortunately I don't think there's a good technical solution to address this issue. Generally, you can consider packages safe if:

\- They're widely used. I hate using popularity as a metric for this, but this means that there's a lot more eyes on the package, so malicious code would have more likely been detected.  
\- They're run as a ""professional"" open-source project, that's actively maintained with multiple contributors.

If you wanted to manually audit packages yourself, you'd probably be looking for suspicious commands in the cmdclass/install section of the [setup.py](https://setup.py) file. This may not do much if you don't know what to look for, and probably won't scale well.

It is a tool that checks an online database for known vulnerabilities. The tool is not infallible (f.ex. I noticed that the two libs in question are not included yet), but it is a *good* step in the right direction.

It can be run in various ways and will tell you if there are any known vulnerabilities of libraries in your project.

As you mention you are a beginner, I reckon that you are not very experience with ""CI-Pipelines"" yet, but `safety` is a tool that makes a lot of sense to include in such a pipeline.

At work we schedule our main pipeline to run daily which includes `safety`. So the day a new vulnerability is known the pipeline fails and we get a notification by mail and can react quickly.

In a similar vain, check out [bandit](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/) as well. It does not check for 3rd party libraries, but checks your own code-base for known security issues. This also makes sense to run in a CI pipeline.

fvxvf5,fmlmbzt,theWyzzerd,"Recursion is a good concept to understand because it will be helpful in solving more difficult problems in the future, but you really should be using a `while` loop in this use case, for both efficiency and readability.

    def on_wall(beer):
        while beer >= 0:
            if beer == 0:
                print(""No more"" + bobotw + "", no more"" + bob)
                print(""Go to the store and buy some more, 99"" + bobotw + ""."")
            elif beer == 1:
                print(str(beer) + "" bottle of beer on the wall, "" + str(beer) + "" bottle of beer."")
                print(take + ""no more"" + bobotw + ""."")
            elif beer == 2:
                print(str(beer) + bobotw + "", "" + str(beer) + bob)
                print(take + ""only one bottle of beer on the wall."")

                print(str(beer) + bobotw + "", "" + str(beer) + bob)
                print(take + str(beer-1) + bobotw + ""."")
            beer -= 1
            

There are a few other things you can do to improve readability, too.  For example, for print statements you should consider using fstrings so you don't get this messy concatenation of variables and string literals.

Consider how well this reads vs. what you've got currently:

    print(f""{beer} {bobotw}, {beer} {bob}"")

edit: fixed some of the code formatting (indentations)

edit2:  removed repetitive `beer -= 1` to be more pythonic.  We only need to reduce it once after we've tested the value against all cases.",2020-04-06 16:06:35

fvxvf5,fmmcd1c,MassW0rks,"I've seen several good suggestions here. I do have a minor suggestions to improve spped in your if-statements. It's generally a good idea to put the most common scenario first. Because an if-statement reads in order, it currently says ""if beer == 0... if beer == 1, etc."" It does this every time, even though a majority of the time, you want to run the else-statment.

 If you switched it to instead say:

* if beer > 2 .....
* if beer == 2...
* if beer == 1...
* else ....

That means that every time the on_wall() function is called, it only has to check the first if statement instead of checking everything and then running the else statement nearly every time.",2020-04-06 19:52:19

aqa74u,egeof82,ELIMINADO,"> It is rare that you have a legitimate reason to be handwriting SQL queries.

I do not agree with this point, and would like to touch on it.

You shouldn't have SQL queries in your application to begin with. These should be wrapped in a Stored Procedure on the database side. 

This provides:

* Separation of Concerns
* A cached Execution Plan on the database-side that will be performant.
* An easier ability to change or fix the queries. Instead of having to change the query in the application and redeploy, you can change the query in the Stored Procedure and as long as the declaration remains the same the app won't care.
* It allows your database experts to keep any queries being run on the database in a secure, confined space and only querying exactly what's needed.

Furthermore, ORMs tend to write sloppy queries and do not account for all the design decisions that a Data Architect/Designer would make. Ultimately, and especially in larger architecture environments - Data Architect's  may need to make the decision on cutting their own wrists and maintaining 3NF or going off the beaten path to keep the architecture simple and performant. An ORM cannot possibly know these design decisions.  

When possible, your SQL should live in your database, and it should be hand-written. Your database should have a well-designed, clean Data Abstraction Layer that does not get in the way of the Application Developer from writing their software and totally nullifies the need for an ORM or any other like tooling.",2019-02-13 20:31:10

If there isn’t one, I think a game like tic-tac-toe is also good. It exposes you to some OOP and just thinking through a project logically.

After you pick a project, struggle with it. Spend hours going through documentations, Stackoverflows, YouTube. If you want, pop open ChatGPT for some real time help. And you will complete your first version.
