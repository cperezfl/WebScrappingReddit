1gqufvm,"60+ year old ""fudge pie"" recipe doesn't work anymore. Can anyone think of why?",2024-11-14 02:22:48,dairy_cow_now,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/1gqufvm/60_year_old_fudge_pie_recipe_doesnt_work_anymore/,468,"This recipe has been a staple at Thanksgiving for at least 60 years. My mom grew up making it, I grew up making it. My grandma taught us the recipe.

The recipe is very much a grandma recipe.

>Fudge Pie
>1/2 stick butter
>2 eggs
>1/2 cup evaporated milk
>1 1/2 cup sugar
>3 tbsp cocoa
>vanilla
>Stir ingredients,  do not beat. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes.


The way we used to make it was to stir everything together then cut the butter in to small bits and sprinkle on top. It would bake, and be a delicious pie that was like a custard texture that tasted like a brownie with a crunchy top. The amount of vanilla is one cap full.


Then, probably about 15-20 years ago it took the pie 45 minutes to bake right. About 10 years ago we can't get it to set. We used to be able to cut into while still warm, and it was set. If we try that now, it's chocolate soup. Delicious, but completely soup. The top looks like it should, but it's not set. Even if we let it cool, it doesn't set. We can leave it in the oven until the crust is black, and it is still soup.

The method hasn't changed so that makes me think something about the ingredients has changed. I know eggs have gotten larger. I have tried 1 egg, I have tried medium eggs. It still doesn't work. The closest I can get is with medium eggs, but the pie has to be refrigerated before it will set. Now I can't even find medium eggs in the stores anymore. The pie never needed to be cooled to set until relatively recently. 

I have tried cold butter, soft butter, melted butter. It will not set.

We always use the same brand of cocoa, vanilla, and evaporated milk that my grandma told us to use.


We would make this pie with her so we know she wasn't pulling any shenanigans like giving us a bad recipe. My grandma died around the time the pie completely stopped working, so my mom and I can't ask her what's going on.


We really want our fudge pie back on the table for Thanksgiving. Can anyone figure out why this recipe no longer works when it was such a good recipe before? We don't want another chocolate lava pie. Though at least this failure is delicious, we just want our fudge pie back.

Edit: https://old.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1gqwh7k/fudge_pie_my_grandma_would_always_make_for/

Proof there is no flour/starch and grandma wasn't hiding the flour lol



FINAL EDIT:

I have made 6 pies in the past 24 hours. All but two were soup. The last two... the very last two were a success.


As I was staring into the oven on the last pie I realized what is going on. I saw the bastard that has ruined so many pies.


In my grandma's oven, the rack was in the middle. There were only 3 slots to place the rack in her oven. I have 5. The antique oven in the house I used to live in had 3. The 1970s oven that baked the pie correctly had 3. As I stared with sheer contempt as the massive size of the modern oven compared to the hot box dinosaurs that used to bake this pie perfectly, I realized the smaller ovens, the middle rack setting was closer to the heating element, with an element that wasn't under a sheet of metal, but on display proudly mere inches away from the rack. I cursed my bastard oven and all the other ovens that failed me. How dare they be so large. My grandma's oven could barely fit a turkey on the bottom rack. My grandma's oven was as old as I was when she taught me to make this stupid pie. All the other ovens I used that this recipe worked were older than I was. The ovens my mom used that baked this recipe correctly were older than me, and failed in newer, larger ovens.


It wasn't setting because of mixing method, ingredients, crust, or pie pan. It wasn't close enough to the fucking heating element.",Sí,5826

Recipe #1 https://houseofyumm.com/thick-chocolate-chip-cookies/#wprm-recipe-container-10198
Recipe #2 https://www.seriouseats.com/super-thick-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe

After making a few batches of cookies over the past few weeks and having some weirdly excessive spreading vs. expectation, I picked 2 recipes to attempt to get actually thick cookies.

I bought new baking soda and baking powder (just in case). I use Nordic Ware Naturals aluminum half sheets (as FYI).  I have an oven thermometer. My oven is accurate and maintains temperature well.

I followed both recipes exactly* and weighed all of my dry ingredients.  I chilled both doughs overnight (14 hours or so), along with my cookie sheets.  I started creaming my butter when it hit 60F for recipe #1 and 58F for recipe #2. My kitchen was very warm (75-80 during the dough making) as I’d toasted sugar all day.

* I did not include nuts in my cookies.  Recipe #1 called them optional, Recipe #2 did not.  I don’t like nuts in chocolate chip cookies.  Also, I used parchment paper. Recipe #1 said silicon baking mats.

My results are a disappointment on the thickness scale.  I also couldn’t get the internal temperature to the target range (175-185) on recipe #2 without darkening my cookies too much.  

They both taste great. Recipe #1 is my new favorite chocolate chip recipe.

Any thoughts as to what might be wrong??",Sí,1099

1b947np,What did I do wrong with my first Macarons Batch?,2024-03-07 20:19:12,LereBeere,https://i.redd.it/ty5zjb1d0zmc1.jpeg,154,"I've followed the recipe to the letter and everything looked alright when I put them in the oven at 356F /180°C. But after a minute the batter oozed out of the skin layer that had formed before. 
Why did this happen? What can I do to prevent this the next time?

This was the recipe:
Macaron Batter
1 cup (125g) powdered sugar
1/2 cup (50g) powdered almonds
3 tbsp (25g) unsweetened cocoa powder
2 large egg whites (66g) , at room temperature
pinch of salt
5 tbsp (75g) granulated sugar

Instructions
Prepare the chocolate macaron shells.
Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC).
Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and have a pastry bag with a plain tip (about 1/2-inch, 1cm) ready.
Grind together the powdered sugar with the almond powder and cocoa so there are no lumps; use a blender or food processor. Then sift the mixture into a large bowl and discard the larger lumps.
Using a mixer beat the egg whites until they begin to rise and hold their shape. While whipping, beat in the granulated sugar until very stiff and firm, about 2 minutes.

Fold the dry ingredients, in two batches, into the beaten egg whites with a rubber spatula. When the mixture is smooth and there are no streaks of egg white, stop folding and scrape the batter into the pastry bag. The macaronage is ready when the batter falls off the spatula in a thick ribbon and starts to settle into the rest of the batter after about 20 seconds. Be cautious not to overmix, as this can lead to flat macarons. 
Pipe the batter on the parchment-lined baking sheets in 1-inch (2.5 cm) circles evenly spaced 1-inch (2.5cm) apart.
Rap the baking sheet a few times firmly on the countertop to flatten the macarons, and remove air bubbles. Allow the macarons to sit for 20 to 30 minutes until a “skin” forms and they are no longer wet when lightly touched.

Bake them for 10-15 minutes. Let cool completely then remove from baking sheet",Sí,1023

I don’t really know what I need to change, did I over or under beat it, do I need a different piping tip? I have no clue. 
As far as a recipe goes I literally asked chatgpt to help me make a meringue and this is what it gave me: 

2 egg whites
1/2 cup (100g) caster sugar
1/4 teaspoon peppermint flavouring
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
A few drops of food colouring 

Whip the Egg Whites:
•	Add the egg whites to the bowl and beat on low speed until foamy.
•	Add the cream of tartar and increase speed to medium-high. (I didn’t have cream of tartar and chatgpt said lemon juice is a substitute)
Add Sugar Gradually:
•	Once soft peaks form, gradually add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, while beating. Continue until the meringue forms stiff, glossy peaks, and the sugar is dissolved.
Add favour (Optional):
Mix in the extract just before the stiff peaks stage. (I also added the food dye here)
Bake (if making baked meringue):
•	Preheat your oven to 90°C (200°F).
•	Pipe or spoon the meringue onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.
•	Bake for 60–75 minutes until dry and crisp on the outside.
Cool:

1/2 cup of granulated sugar

I haven't been active on this board for very long, but so far I've really enjoyed everyone and everything on here. As a professional in the culinary industry for over 15 years, and a professional pastry chef for the last 8, I love being able to share what I've learned over the years with those either just breaking into the hobby, home bakers looking to turn it up a notch, or even other professionals looking for new ideas. This sub has been a real pleasure, so thank you. 

That being said, I just want to point out something I've noticed lately. A lot of users who are having issues with recipes are getting them from sources like Tasty, SoYummy, and BuzzFeed. If it seems like these sites are a great place for some recipes, please understand that these are not always reputable sources. For one, they have been known to steal ideas from other internet contributors, and are really designed to make money by getting you to watch their videos. They are not looking out for your best interests, only their own. 

If you are using a recipe that you found in a time lapsed sped up video or from a group that is known for making these videos, please try another recipe first. You are so much better off finding a better cookie or cake or muffin recipe than you are trying to find advice on how to fix a broken one. 

Even as a professional, it is really difficult to know what went wrong with a recipe, ESPECIALLY if I can't taste or touch it. It's taken me 10 years of refinement to get a perfect brownie recipe, and I'm STILL working on the chocolate chip cookie. This doesn't just happen over night, and a lot of trial and error is involved, plus a ton of wasted ingredients (unless you're lucky enough like I am to have an SO who will eat anything) If you don't want to have to go through all this time and effort and flour, you're better off finding a food blog you really like rather than these baking videos. 

Now, I'm not trying to shame anyone. If you use these sources and they've worked for you, that's fantastic! Keep baking! But if you've used them and something seems off, please consider that it's not you, it's the recipe. 

That's it from me. Happy trails, and keep baking!

Edit: I just want to make something clear. If you successfully use these sources for baking, that's awesome! But I don't need to know about it. Please don't share your success stories in an attempt to prove me wrong. This isn't a wrong or right thing, and I'm not trying to make any arguments.  

I just want newer bakers to understand that if you use them and they DON'T work, it is more likely the recipe than anything you did.

EDIT 2: WOA! I've never gotten a Reddit award before! Not sure what it means, but COOL! Thanks kind stranger! I'm just trying to do my part in helping bakers everywhere. :) <3

EDIT 3: WOA!! A platinum award. Wow. Thanks kind Reddit stranger! I will used this to pass love and cheer to other baking subs! <3<3
Also, lots of people asking me for my brownie recipe. I'm okay with giving it away.. maybe we could ask the mods for a special dispensation to post it? That'd be cool.

EDIT 4: I'm starting to think Tasty is trouble shooting their recipes by posting them here. This is the 3rd post I've seen like this in the last month, for the same recipe...

I caramelized the sugar to a nice brown, set them in the bottom of the ramekins, poured in my custard - liquids were combined, double strained, but not heated at all before going in. 

I put six ramekins in a hot water bath, wrapped foil over the tops of each ramekins but not the water bath tray. 

Cooked for 50 minutes at 350 and rotated the tray half way though the cook time. 

I let them cool off to room temperature and then put them in the fridge overnight with the foil kept on. 

The flan was fully cooked and nicely firm the way I like flan, but there wasn’t much caramel “sauce” because the sugar base didn’t dissolve completely. 

- should I have heated the custard liquid before pouring? (Recipe didn’t call for it)

- should I have put an additional foil cover over the water bath tray to add more steam?

I’m a long-time home cook/baker and figured I’d try out croissants on holiday break. I followed the Claire Saffitz recipe and took some progress pics. 1: laminated dough 2: formed croissants 3: proofed croissants 4: baked croissants. I’d love some tips for improvement!

Right off the bat I noticed when making the detrempe before adding the butter it was too dry according to Claire’s recipe so I gradually added water until it seemed right and then proceeded. Maybe my flour protein percentage was off? I was using harvest mills and that has pretty wide range.

The lamination seemed okay until the final fold where I could see butter peaking through at the edges. Could this be bc it was too warm? Or maybe the folding and alignment was off?

I proofed in my oven for two hours with the light  on. I was afraid the steamed oven would melt the butter and I fear I was right! Even in this proofing environment I could see some melted butter leaking. Unsure how to fix this because a colder temperature would hinder proofing?

They proofed with a fervor and came out quite uneven. Is this over proofing?

Claire said to only egg was the smooth surfaces not the folds but mine proofed so unevenly they were like 80% exposed folds haha. They didn’t take on enough color and I had to egg wash again halfway through baking.

The crumb cake out quite tight. Is this glad to over proofing? Underproofing? Overworking the dough? I’d love some advice for improvement?",Sí,660

I recently tried the Levain Cookie recipe from Hijabs and Aprons, but I'm struggling with the center of my cookies coming out raw or underbaked. I followed all the ingredients as listed, including the suggested baking time. The only adjustments I made were halving the ingredients and leaving out the walnuts, as the recipe mentioned this was fine (I substituted with some extra all-purpose flour as instructed).

I'm baking with a conventional oven and I checked the temperature with an oven thermometer to make sure it reached the right temp. However, the middle of my cookies still looks darker and underbaked, which is quite noticeable compared to the fully baked edges. I wouldn't mind it the center was just slightly gooey, but the color difference makes it obvious they're not fully done.

Does anyone have suggestions on what might be causing this?

1azkgjx,Green Spots on Fridge-Proofed Bagels,2024-02-25 10:03:42,CrackerBrie,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1azkgjx,85,"Hi AskBaking, I’m hoping you can help me out with an issue I’ve been having with bagel dough…

The recipe I follow calls for flour, malt powder, salt, yeast and water. After kneading, the recipe calls for shaping the bagels and stick them (resting on parchment paper on a baking tray, covered with clingfilm) in the fridge for 12/24/48hrs. 

I shaped these on Friday night and left them untouched until today. When I lifted them off the parchment paper to boil, I noticed that every single bagel has these unsightly green/grey spots on the bottom that look pretty grim. 

I’m hoping it’s not mould, but also stumped as to what it could be - attaching photos (hopefully this works). What’s happening to my otherwise delicious, sexy bagels?!",Sí,559

My recipe is

250g all purpose
125g water
50g butter
25g sugar
2 tsp of salt

125g of butter block

1. Mix everything except butter until shaggy dough forms (not to over knead)
2. Work butter in to form smooth dough and window pane test (does not require a lot of kneading. Maybe 5 minutes)
3. Overnight in the fridge
4. Book fold -> 30 minutes rest -> letter fold -> 1 hr rest -> final rolling

Its seems every other recipe talks about how easy they make things, and EVERY video I see online uses one. 

So I saved up and finally bought a 6 qt bowl lift kitchen aid from Costco because they were on a huge sale. And I feel like it was a huge waste of money. 

Is there really supposed to be a good centimeter of clearance where nothing get mixed? And even more on the bottom it seems? I mean I get that you don’t want your attachments to hit the bowl because that could damage them… but does it need to be that far away? I feel like all of the convenience of the mixer is overshadowed by the amount of time I am spending scraping down that stupid bowl. 

I was trying to cream a cup of butter and a cup of sugar today for cookies. I thought that would be plenty of volume to use the mixer. But every fifteen seconds or so I had to stop the mixer and scrape it down because all of the mixture got pushed up the sides and wasn’t getting mixed anymore. Is that user error? Am I missing something? Do I need to be making triple batches of cookies in order to make this thing worth it? I couldn’t help but think the whole time about how much easier it would have been with my hand mixer. 

I’m just feeling very defeated. The draw of the stand mixer was to be able to wash dishes or help my kids while things were mixing - but it seems this machine just isn’t made to do that. Is a kitchenaid just not for me? Or am I missing something?
