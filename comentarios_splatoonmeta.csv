xe4qqb,ioiv793,Hitzel,"A few of these choices scream month 1 syndrome and will probably drop fast (like dapples and zap), and some probably won't stay as low as they are over time (like slosher and tent when it gets patched).

Remember that a tier list is simply a snapshot of what the highest levels of competitive play look like *right now*.  Tier placement for individual weapons can mean something to the author that isn't immediately recognizable to the reader if you don't have full context.  For example, something can be high or low based on its unique matchups against one or two comps that are considered good right now, but if that changes next week all reasoning for that weapon's position goes out the window.

1f6wy7s,ll3heic,VertHigurashi,"Professional splatoon players don't make money. Period. Top level players who stream don't get much. If he wants to continue to grind the game and improve, then fine, but being a ""professional"" won't pay the bills.",2024-09-02 03:57:17
1f6wy7s,ll3hldr,ELIMINADO,"There are basically no “professional Splatoon players” in the way there are for Fortnite, Valorant, LOL, etc. there’s a small handful of people who are able to make a full time living off of Splatoon YouTube but I’d bet good money that even ProChara, by far the largest and most established Splatuber in the west, is driving for Uber to make ends meet. There’s definitely no sponsored teams or big cash prize tournaments in the US. I’m not TOTALLY sure how it works in other countries but I think it’s an issue with the Nintendo IP, not the popularity of the game.",2024-09-02 03:58:48
1f6wy7s,ll3m7od,soda_sofa,"the biggest prize pots are like 200 dollars and those only come around every 3-4 months. splatoon players dont get sponsorships like other esports and the scene isnt big enough for streaming. the only real avenue is content creation, which is too saturated to be much more than a side hustle. 

Most Comp players play for a love of the game. we enjoy the depth and getting better and its much closer to a hobby. He should just get a real job and play comp for fun like the rest of us.

The best argument you probably have is that the tippiest top of players have to sell their limited edition controllers to make ends meet (and still cant find a buyer for one out of 16 existing controllers)",2024-09-02 04:37:46
1f6wy7s,ll3uel6,ddbllwyn,Wait till your brother finds out that there’s a S+ rank,2024-09-02 05:53:12
1f6wy7s,ll41x3x,Follyf,"Getting to S rank is nothing in competitive Splatoon, especially after thousands of hours. The only slightly meaningful part of SoloQ is X rank, which you unlock after S+0. Does your brother have any knowledge or experience doing competitive gaming in general? Has he been tried going to a team building discord server to try and get in the scene? I’d recommend starting with that if you want to start getting in to competitive Splatoon. You can also join other servers like Inkademy and Stronghold to interact with others.

By playing with other people and being involved more, you’ll probably find that you’ll get better very quickly. I quit Splatoon about a month ago because of burnout, but I’ve been playing since the first game and saw little improvement until about 3 years ago when I joined a team and started being around more Splatoon players. I went from A+ to X rank in a few modes (300 hours) and then with SendouQ in Splatoon 3 the improvements only came faster. I’d thoroughly recommend getting into playing SendouQ, it’s a great way to build connections with different players who also take the game as seriously as you do.

Plus, if your brother really does want to be a professional player and make money, he does need to realise that Splatoon is absolutely not the game if you want to make money. Nintendo simply doesn’t fund the scene enough unfortunately. I played competitive Smash Bros before Splatoon and I actually did make some money playing that, but still not enough to make it a job. Most Nintendo Esports lack Nintendo’s support to have large prize pools like bigger competitive scenes do like LoL, Rocket League, Fortnite, DOTA, etc. Those games’ competitive scenes are backed up by their respective companies, which allows them to thrive and have huge prize pools for both major and also some small tournaments too. 

To summarise, if you or your brother want to become ‘professional’ Splatoon players, you need to begin to form connections with other players who take the game seriously at slightly above your skill level (which is a lot of people if you look in high level servers) so you can learn from them and improve faster. Join those discord servers, start entering some low level tournaments, these will all vastly help you. However, you do need to acknowledge that Splatoon is not a game if you want to start paying the bills; very few tournaments have a prize pool high enough to start doing that regularly. If you want to earn lots of money, either look for a different game to grind or do something else because Splatoon will not fulfil those needs",2024-09-02 07:09:49
1f6wy7s,ll3epcp,amberlite,"Thousands of hours and just reaching S rank doesn’t make sense. Like almost impossible for someone their age to take that long. You could probably get carried to S in that number of hours even if you are a terrible player. I don’t know about being a professional splatoon player, but I’d think they should be playing in X mode (which sounds like they aren’t even in yet) and getting in top rankings. 

Do they have a following on Twitch?",2024-09-02 03:35:53
1f6wy7s,ll45q07,KirbsOatmeal2,"There no sponsorships in Splatoon and money is generally beyond  scarce, and the community doesn’t care enough to fix or change that. You make more even on entry level jobs. There’s a reason most the best splat players are young and ultimately, if you ain’t even S+ and at 23 rn I don’t think you will exactly not want a day job instead. There’s a bunch of 16-19 year olds that I know who could prolly kick your brothers ass by a long shot. So not only is he chasing a non viable source of income but also he’s nowhere near the top and a bit above the age category for doing so.

With that much time he should be S+ at least and somewhere decent in X power, but he’s not even improving at a good rate; he’s playing without thinking and is headed for stagnation anyways, nor does it seem like he’s reaching out to improve better in a game that ultimately, getting to the top revolves around networking and groups. 

Tbh tho, despite all the issues here I dont exactly think living w parents is a bad thing or the issue here. Finding a house In this economy is becoming more a pipe dream by the minute for a lot of people. This doesn’t detract from a lot of the other issues tho here",2024-09-02 07:51:56

1f6wy7s,ll47ns0,RenderedBike40,"The only way to make actual money out of this game is to be a content creator. Tournament prize pots do exist but they are few and incredibly far between and often no more than $20 per player (and only for special events). As much as I hate to say it, S rank means absolutely NOTHING competitively. Even people in the lowest divisions could probably dog on S ranks (not saying that to be rude or say you suck, but splatoon’s ranking system is really bad when put into the context of comp)",2024-09-02 08:13:48

ys7uhw,iw20n84,Gloomy_Woomy,"I was originally going to say I would've liked for IRU to cut down on the ink recovery delay, while providing no benefit to the rate of recovery (it'd work normally if there was no delay). I did some math with (imo) reasonable numbers for this hypothetical IRU.

Let's say you throw a bomb and immediately submerge yourself for exactly 60 frames:

- In the real game, you would spend 0 frames recovering ink and thus recover 0% of your tank, regardless of how much IRU you had.

- 19 AP of hypothetical IRU lets you recover ink for 15 frames. During those 15 frames, you would recover ink at the default rate, recovering 8.33% of your tank.

I thought that was about fair, so I then did the math for a version of IRU that gave you 15 bonus frames of recovery _and_ an increase in the rate of recovery. Surely that'd be overkill, with the bonus from 19 AP (an entire pure!) of irl IRU.

...10.2%. Not even an extra 2% of your tank, for A PURE.

Or how about on the Junior? It's base ink recovery of 3.32 because of it's expanded ink tank actually gets decent value out of two subs of Ink Recovery, getting close to the standard 3 second fill time with two subs 3.32 vs 3.08 with just two subs.",2022-11-11 17:41:06
ys7uhw,ivzpx9q,Slimedaddyslim,"Would it be good on the Splattershot Jr? I saw a few people recommending it on that weapon since it has a larger ink tank than other guns and helps with bomb spam.

ypx53i,ivnaciw,Cutlession,"I believe this was for tower control right? Crab tank has the bonus of being able to stay on the tower with strong defense and insane offence and it's limited mobility being not much of a factor since you have to stay on the tower anyway. I feel like bubbler would also be good but because it's duration is lowered on the tower, it's only alright. It's not a the gun they want it's the special. The booyah bomb forcing everyone off the tower is nice but lot's of special can do that. Meanwhile for staying on the tower you have bubbler and crab tank... that's about it. Ink vacuum is an option but your e-liter has to swap to default charger or range blaster has to swap to rapid blaster pro to do so, weapons that have less success on T.C.

I’d then personally replace the Ink Resistance main with ninja squid, and cut out the Main Power Up subs for some ink resistance instead. Special Power Up could go to Swim Speed Up possibly.

It would look like

SCU | SSU SSU SSU (Special Charge, Swim Speed x3)
NINJA | QSJ SSU SSU (Ninja Squid, Quick Super Jump, Swim Speed x2)
SSU | BDEFX SPU SPU (Swim Speed, Bomb Defense, Sub Power Up x2)

10jxvms,j5tj0d3,Hitzel,"Be careful you don't over-value Sub Power on Beakons.

The biggest influence you can have on how effective your Beakons are is your in-game behavior.  Simply leaving beakons at the right times such that people have jump-ins when needed to keep pressure up is the most important thing.  Their exact location isn't that important, and how fast people jump back in isn't very important.  You can have zero sub power and place them where you happen to stand when they're needed, and the effect you have on the game will be identical to if you wasted the ability slots and time/effort to set up ""better beakons.""

In other words, you're able to easily get above par Beakons without the use of Sub Power, so the question becomes; is it worth a third of your build to improve what's already good enough?  A 6th of your build?  Where's your line?

For me personally, it's never been more than a sub or two and nowadays I don't even run Sub Power when I could be running more QR or whatever.

The set looks alright overall, with a few major issues concerning the amount per ability:

Ink saver main
The Hydra is a very ink efficient weapon. Ink saver main is a wasted ability. If you wish, go for 1-2 subs of main power up since that inkreases ink efficiency/shot as well as the duration of burst

Bomb defense up DX
I don't want to dismiss BDUDX as a good ability, but 3 subs is a LOT. And especially with a backline weapon you aren't going to need it a lot. 1 sub at most.

Special charge up
This is also, a good ability, suitable for armor and all, but it's too much. Abilities function after diminishing returns, meaning the effect per sub get less the more you add to it.
Furthermore, Hydra isn't a support weapon, meaning you shouldn't be special breeding/supporting, but instead anchor for your team.

Run speed up
We got through what there was too much off, but what do you need the space for?
Run speed up is essential for any Splatling (except Nautilus) and it's rare to see any top Splatling (Kaji, Bliss, Yuno, etc) use less than a pure and it's usually even more.
Hydra is a very slow weapon, meaning it can use any utility it can get.

Utility abilities
Their are some abilities that can be used on any set as stated by DUDE [in this video](https://youtu.be/Nk_N7VDQxiY)
Quick super jump is important for any slow weapon/backliner because of how you can leave dangerous situations that you are unable to win anyways by jumping back to spawn, would use 1/2subs
Special saver is rather good to have for when you die (and you will even as backliner, it's not easily avoidable without making mistakes) and need your special again quick, eg. Armor for your team after a wipe trying to reengage
Ink recovery might be handy, but not necessary at all.
if you need something to sacrifice even more, might be a sub of swim speed up. Movement speed is important and 2/3 subs is a good amount but 2 subs are okay if you need a different ability in its place

Non-essential spu
Special power up. Not sure about the numbers for armor but I think using enough for the armor to tank 30 damage is too much for a Hydra so I'd just suggest like one sub for getting it out quicker.
Not necessary, still nice.

Okay, that was a lot. But still, take it all with a grain of salt, I haven't played Hydra in a while, frankly because it isn't the best weapon.
And with that comes a disclaimer: this is my opinion. There are people who would use less of those subs, or more. A lot of people use 1m2s of main power up, some use only 1/2 subs of ink resistance, the biggest essential abilities are Run speed up and quick super jump, everything else is up to your playstyle, what I described is the set for a suiting play style, that in my opinion is ideal.

Stay back, hide behind corners/obstacles while charging, then come out to release all of it. Keep your opponents at the biggest distance possible that is still inside your range. Don't stand in dangerous spots. Exploit high ground and keep away from low ground/narrow alleys etc. Support your team, but don't get carried away and anchor. That means not approaching, but having people approach you and kill them when they try to push you.",2020-04-02 05:59:51

ftcp5l,fm8e7bs,invisime,"Hydra main (ish*) here. I recently reached X-Rank in all modes. I much prefer the original to the custom, so some of what I'm saying may only make sense in that context.

*""ish"" is because I like using a lot of different weapons. I did used to play Hydra almost exclusively while I was grinding my way up to X-Rank in Rainmaker.

With the non-custom Hydra, I tend to be a bit of a grenadier. I like using an autobomb to keep track of someone while I'm charging, then splat them if they dodge the 'nade. Because of this, at least 1 main or 3 subs goes to Ink Saver Sub. I wouldn't use any for mines though.

Similarly, the Special Charge Up would be waaay overkill on the non-custom. Since its special is Splashdown, you will spend a lot of time with it fully charged just waiting for the right time to panic use it or super jump bomb. I don't know if it's that much different for the Custom. I'd trust /u/Sora_hishoku on it.

Speaking of which, his advice on Bomb Defense Up DX is spot-on. In fact, I don't usually use any of it unless I know I'm in a level where the sniping spots are especially reachable by grenade. (For example, the four tall spots overlooking the stage in Starfish Mainstage.)

Run Speed is huge. Spend a few rounds in turf with a Minisplatling but no Run Speed. Then max out your Run Speed (to the best of your gear) and play some as a Heavy or Hydra Splatling. I know it sounds silly, but it's tough to really see the full impact of Run Speed without doing that kind of side-by-side. I only skimp on Run Speed if the stage doesn't have any uninkable surfaces. On a stage like Shellendorf or Kelp Dome, I'd consider running more than usual.

Ink Resistance is also really big. Because you have to charge to shoot, it will frequently be more expedient to ignore the fact that you're standing on enemy ink. I usually run 1 main or 3 subs on any splatling. For that matter, most rollers too.

Swim Speed is comparatively less important. As an anchor, you will (on average) die less than your teammates. Fewer deaths = less time swimming. You are also more likely to be the last one to die in the event of a team wipe. In this case, everyone else will have spawned before you and you'll have someone to jump to. Again, less swimming. The one exception to the ""swimming's not that important"" rule is if you're playing Rainmaker. Since Hydra's are already are a charged weapon, splat from range, and move slowly, you are one of the better weapons to be the carrier. In that case, you'll really want the Swim Speed.

In general, I don't run Ink Saver Main on a Hydra. You're not usually going to need to shoot very much without repositioning at least enough to get full again. The exceptions are if you're playing Turf or Zones. In those cases, you're more likely to run out while staying in the same place.

A couple other recommendations before I finish this (already too long) comment:

Object Shredder is a reasonable choice in Rainmaker since you will be able to pop or hold the barrier very well from a long distance. It doesn't make sense most of the rest of the time. If you go this route, you might also consider splashing some Main Power Up, since the damage bonuses stack. (I think. I don't know how to test to be sure.)

Respawn Punisher is also a reasonable choice for any anchor role. This is because you die less often, so you will not experience the negative effects as much. It's also (as always) a bit of gamble since you have to actually splat people for it to do anything.

If Respawn Punisher seems too risky, Thermal Ink is pretty good for the Hydra. It's not uncommon to nick someone at extreme range only for them to retreat. Thermal Ink lets you keep track of them for a while, then pop them as soon as they get back in range. With the addition of either Hydra's sub, Thermal Ink puts you among the top few ""locator""-focused builds. That's a great place to be as a backliner. You want to know where everyone is. Even more than usual.

I think that just about does it for me. I hope this was informative. Stay fresh!",2020-04-02 17:16:37

ftcp5l,fm6gng8,loves_cereal,"I main the hydra and I would have some suggestions, but I’m not in X yet, I’m S+8. 
The key to this weapon is staying alive and farming those armors for your team, so the main of special charge up is great. I’d suggest a main or a few subs of Jump Speed and get really good at exiting a stressful situation or repositioning if your team is down. 
I’d probably not use a main for ink resistance either. If anything you’ll see that a sub or two is enough generally with any weapon, but I wouldn’t main it. I don’t use it on my hydra build at all. 
Sub power up can help make the mines last longer, so you may consider adding some of that. 
It’s a slow weapon, so a main of Run or even up to a pure of Run will do some good. Have you looked at https://sendou.ink/builds There’s a lot of submissions for decent builds. It’s worth a look to compare. I probably wouldn’t run comeback...I find that to be better for a slayer.

For Hydra I wouldn't go with more than 1 sub each. You don't want to play anywhere near enemy ink in the first place, so you could use that main slot better.  Additionally I would consider using 1 sub of quick super jump and only 2 subs of swim speed. At these amounts the ability points have the strongest effect and the effectiveness of any further subs is drastically lower.

You could maybe get a way with a little bit less but having that extra mobility is really vital imo. I also would say that you don't really that much if any special charge up/special saver. Hydra isn't a weapon that you use for its special as it paints badly and special gauge is pretty high, and there's just better abilities that you could use instead. Tenacity is okay, it's definitely a weapon that benefits from it but I'm not how useful it really is but if it works for you. Object shredder is pretty decent, but I would probably only use it in rain maker but it's definitely helpful in shredding armour in any mode. I would also add more ink resistance maybe just one or two more subs. Something that is really good for hydra is mpu as you need so little of it for effect. All you need is one main and two subs and you go from a four shot kill to a three shot kill.

I've also added 3 subs of Special Power Up for shorter activation / longer duration. Finally, I finish it off with my ""splash"" abilities: Ink Resistance, Bomb Defense Up, and Quick Super Jump on a Splatfest replica. It's definitely not fully optimized, but I find it really functional.

I think Object Shredder is definitely worth it because Ink Armor is sooo common in the current meta. There's also an awful lot of Ink Curtain and Baller lately, with the .52's recent buff. I may experiment with dropping the Special Charge Up for MPU since I believe the damage buff stacks with Object Shredder.

I'd consider dropping the Ink Saver Main. Unless you're playing Turf (or maybe Zones), you should really be moving often enough that you won't need it.

Cooler's most notable benefits is its mobility buffs and safety net. And as overtuned as those may be, they aren't—and perhaps never will be—particularly helpful at getting back into a game, as most weapons can only really move as fast as their (team's) turf output and a safety net is...well, just that.

Afaik, the only times where Cooler could even potentially match the potency of other specials like Wavebreaker are during sustained, relatively guaranteed pushes/spawncamps. Your team can make full use of the extra mobility, but only after you've established paint control in the enemy base. The lessened sting from dying can actually show itself because dying at all isn't immediately detrimental to your situation.

I personally don't like the sub of Intensify Action in Chara's build because the weapon's accuracy is not great to begin with.

I'm also a huge advocate for single bomb builds. It feels a lot better throwing a bomb and paint, building special instead of just throwing 2 bombs and sit there for ~3 seconds recharging. Double bomb builds are fine but it really harms your painting and specials per match in the long run. You can also just chuck in LDE and get double bomb with just only having around 10AP instead of half your gear being ISS. You could instead run SCU, NinjaSquid, even Sub Power Up if you prefer.

The problem is that if your team isn't around you, it's not hard for an enemy to get behind you and just kill you. Or if they have a fast rate of fire, they can just continuously shoot at you, fill up your vac, but splat you before you can get your shot off.

It can be useful if your team is coordinated enough, but even then it's situational, and in 1v1 situations, you're basically a sitting duck.",2023-05-20 15:40:06
13mxtiz,jkx2dt5,YeLucksman,"One of the core problems is that the enemy can very easily deny you value.

The sides and back being vurnerable is fair. Stamp, jet, crab etc can all also be countered in somewhat the same way. The problem is, those all have a way to get value if if they get killed early. A stamp might have already had some stamp/just throw the thing. A jet probably already shot a few shots and possibly got people displaced/killed. A crab already got value even before you killed as it still gets to shoot during the time you spend killing it.

Meanwhile vac has nothing really like that. You only really get value if you eat a booyah/bomb and get out alive if you don't get the shot off. If you get that shot off but die (either because you have an akward pauze between the vac being full and firing or someone picked you off) you better hope you hit someone, because if you don't there really isn't much value gotten from the paint (unlike crab or jet who tend to be more of a threat).

And you can just approach a vac without a cost. A stamp is dangerous to approach, so is a crab. A jet has the dodge and can also be dangerous if they spot you and manage to land a shot near you. Vac meanwhile gets nothing while charging, making it far less of a cost to approach a vac and just go around them.",2023-05-20 16:12:26
13mxtiz,jky9txb,CHAINMAILLEKID,"Because it is the worst special in the game, its almost actively detrimental.


#1.
Your ability to contribute to the objective while using it.

For however long Ink Vac is up, there's so much important stuff you're not able to do for your team. In some ways your team needs to act like they're a man down.

You'd think that vacuuming up opponent ink would reduce the opposite teams ink output, but all else being equal if the ink vac is out your team is being out-inked.

#2. 

Its support really isn't great. Many situations it would be much better support for teammates just to have your gun out. Ink Vac is only practical at these times because it allows you a way to support the team after your ink tank is empty.

#3.

How effective it is doesn't rely on how good the user is with their special, it relies on how good your teammates are with your special.

If I spend lots of time to coach my teammates on how to play, and esp if I have a mic to walk them through, tell them the tanks about to be filled and they're going to be vulnerable, or they're getting too far away, etc, then it can be good. 

Another way of saying that is Ink Vac can't protect players as they would play normally. They have to adapt their play in order for it to be something Ink Vac can effectively support. And that's an outrageous expectation.

#4

Lack of variability. Predictable things can be exploited. Ink Vac cannot mix up their options enough to avoid being punished. Its just way too predictable. Opponents have almost as much control and influence on when my shot charges as I do.

#5.

Its safe to contest.
Anybody can contest an Ink Vac, and usually the worst that happens is you'll trade. If the Ink Vac has teammates, getting to the Ink Vac can become prohibitively difficult. But assuming you can get to them, you can splat them or at least trade.

#6

Ink Vac simply is ineffective at all against too many other weapons and specials.

The fact that it does nothing to melee attacks just makes it wide open for abuse from those weapons. It essentially does nothing against dualies either.

Could you imagine if rollers and dualies were immune to Booyah Bomb for some reason? Its sorta like that.

#7

Netcode.

The way hit detection works I don't think works in Ink Vacs favor. And I think is a fundemental reason why protecting teammates doesn't work. If I were to guess, its because the other systems you're communicating with don't verify with your system what shots you have/haven't vacuumed up. If you're trying to protect your buddy, its up to their connection to recognize that your vac sucked up the shots that would have hit them. But considering how imperfect online is, and how much desync there can be in where I am and where I'm aiming on my screen vs what I'm doing on my teammates screen, that protection is simply unreliable.

There's other things too, like Ink Vac will very routinely suck up bombs, splat bombs, auto bombs, sticky bombs, and even booyah bombs, slup them up, prevent the damage, even fill the vac tank, but it does not prevent the bombs from inking the stage. Same thing can happen with shots. Its extremely easy and common to find yourself stuck standing in enemy ink from attacks that got sucked into the vac, but still managed to ink the ground on the stage anyway.

Something is busted in the netcode.

It’s also incredibly predictable because you can’t prematurely fire off the shot at the end like you can with throwing Ultra Stamp. And since you can’t paint while it’s out (besides Tenta Brella shield) your movement is severely hindered even though you can still swim unlike Triple Inkstrike.

xtuj5l,iqskbts,squidtrap,"I saw your comment about the shoes, but in my experience with a couple thousand hours on S1+2 (much of it with a Hydra) I feel that as a backline slayer, IRU is kind of useless. You're not usually in a position where you would be encumbered by enemy ink, so that frees up some space in the rest of your build. 

Instead, I would focus on improving what the Hydra is best at...notably, killing very quickly and from a distance. Get enough Main Saver Up so that you can get 3 full charges from each tank. A little Ink Refill Up (not much) wouldn't hurt, but that is to your preference. And I tend to prefer Tenacity over SCU, as it's more passive and you're not exactly inking all the time with a Hydra, at least in ranked modes. I try not to focus on specials a lot, (well in S1 I did bc echolocator was OP) but I can see how Booyah Bombs would come in handy in zones and TC.

nf33su,gykx3uu,jusbecks,"Hello! I’m an anchor main (Charger) since day 1 (2000 hours into the game), all X rank and top XP 2400.

First, I want to say that the fact that you’re losing can’t be necessarily pinned on your performance. From what I see in these clips, you’re doing your job well enough.

Now, on to what I see that can be improved.

**Positioning**: You’ve mentioned that you’re new to playing anchor, and that explains a lot about your positioning. To be fair, in all of those matches you were outranged by someone (Hydra or E-liter), which is never an easy match for an anchor, specially concerning positioning.

Still, frequently you seemed to be a bit lost concerning where you should be. At times, you would leave a perfectly good spot at that moment, where it was aggro enough for you to impact on the game, safe enough considering the amount of control you had, and where you could make the most of your range, such as the snipe, and you would leave that spot for apparent no reason and put yourself in positions where you didn’t have a good angle on opponents, or where it was easier for shorter ranged opponents to rush you.

In other moments, when you really should’ve been repositioning due to a change in the state of control in the match, there was too much hesitation, and you would take too long to go where you should’ve been or you would position yourself in a spot where you couldn’t do much, whereas if you would’ve positioned yourself differently you would’ve been able to impact a lot more on the game. 

Positioning can’t be taught, sadly, as it’s more of a result of experience, and I’m sure the more you play as an anchor, the more you’ll learn how to position yourself properly (it’s fine as it is, though).

**Special usage**: You need to get more value out of your special. If you watch these matches again, you’ll see that less than half of the specials you used accomplished anything.

There should be more intention and more awareness when you use your special.

If you’re going to throw it at the zone, make sure your teammates are in position to be able to follow up on it and paint. If not, it’s really easy for the enemy team to just paint over it, and you’ve wasted your special.

Also, try to position yourself in a spot where you’ve got clearer visibility of the battlefield and where the elevation that Booyah Bomb gives you will help you have a better idea of what’s happening at the moment. You don’t need to throw it as soon as it’s charged, take your time, hold it in the air, stall, strategize where you’re throwing it, let your teammates use that couple of seconds to put themselves in a position where they can follow up on your special.

More importantly, though, don’t throw your special by itself. It’s not difficult to dodge a Booyah Bomb, specially one that wasn’t intentionally thrown specifically on you. So if you throw your special by itself, more often than not you’ll accomplish nothing with it. But if you coordinate with your teammates, or what’s probably more realistic in S rank, if you wait until someone else on your team uses their special and then you use yours, your special will have a lot more impact. Missiles are great, for example, cause your opponents will have to move to escape, and then you could use that to predict their trajectory and bait them into your Booyah Bomb. 

Or else, use your special reactively. You can cancel Bomb Rushes, you can stop your enemies from pushing in by throwing the Booyah Bomb in their way, and many other things.

Whatever you do, use your special with intention, not just randomly.

**Point sensors**: You don’t use point sensors not nearly enough as you should.

First, point sensors are great in Ranked, cause you can help your teammates know where opponents are, specially players you believe your teammates might have missed. So, that match where you kept getting flanked, throwing a point sensor at your opponent would help your teammates pay more attention to that player, and maybe even come help you, so you could stop wasting time with the flanker.

More importantly, though, point sensors are really helpful to you as well. Frequently in those matches you were just shooting in the general direction of your opponents, but not specifically at someone, and of course most of the time you didn’t accomplish much out of it. If you had thrown your point sensors , you would know exactly where to point to. Not to mention that it stops people from sneaky plays, trying to flank, etc.

And again, you wasted so many Booyah Bombs by just throwing them in a general direction, where you didn’t even know if there was someone there. If you throw your point sensors before using your special, you can be sure that you’re throwing it at someone specifically.

**”Being a beacon”**: Honestly, people put way too much emphasis on that, and I’m guessing most of those people aren’t even anchor mains and they’re just repeating what they heard from others. I watch *a lot* of competitive play and I follow a lot of top anchors (and I had discussions with many of them about playing Anchor), and it’s not as if that being a live beacon is their priority concerning their positioning.

Yes, that’s something that you should have in mind, but the usefulness of it is entirely dependent on context, and in Solo Q (specially in lower ranks) teammates don’t really make use of it properly. They’ll jump to you at the worst possible times, and when you back up to let them jump to you, they’ll completely ignore you.

Being a live beacon becomes a natural thing when you simply back up at moments when you’re at man disadvantage and you can’t do much to stop the enemy team. There’s no reason to stay pushed up when you just lost 2 players. Back up, go to a safe position and if someone wants to jump to you, hide their jump. If not, proceed playing as usual.


Anyway, I know it’s a lot, but this is what I can point out from what I’ve seen.

If you’re interested, I’ve got a channel on YouTube with educational content and I’m currently finishing my Anchor guide. If you’re interested, check it out in the near future. Look up for Your Splatoon.

Good luck!",2021-05-18 15:42:28
nf33su,gyjio1o,Inspirational_Lizard,"You're doing good already! Just make sure to keep your opponents just in your range. Most of the time you died was because enemies got in your face. If you keep them at a distance you become very hard to kill. As for snipers, they usually stay still, so aim at them behind cover, then move out and blast them. They will out range you but if you can do what the enemies did to you can kill them, as long as you have your reticle on them as you move out of cover, so they have no time to react.",2021-05-18 06:54:26
nf33su,gyjgpfe,an_angry_beaver,"A month ago, you fine folks reviewed my clips using K machine. I got some solid feedback but I've decided to try playing anchor instead (it was recommended to me and am enjoying it) and am in need of new/different advice. I'm clearly doing something wrong since I keep losing :/

These clips focus on Splat Zones playing heavy splatling. Some thoughts: I'm concerned I'm not helping create 2v1s by being out of position. In the second clip, I didn't know how to deal with the sniper (or perhaps that's not my job). Also, I don't think I did a good job acting as a beakon since few teammates jumped to me or if they did, they died. Any advice on these matters and what other errors do you see?

Thanks so much.

Hat - Last ditch effort and the universal value subs, quick super jump/ink resistance/bomb defense. You can't really go wrong with this.

Shirt - 2 swim speed subs and a special saver is pretty much always good. The main ability here is hardest to pin down, but I'd say quick respawn if you tend to play more aggressive weapons, special charge if you play more midline/backline. Maybe have one shirt for each if you're willing to put in the extra effort.

Shoes - literally just have different shoes for different weapons, but farm the sub slots for chunks. You don't need to grind to obtain these, it keeps you at least a little flexible, and you're working towards making more specific builds in the future. Get 1 star gear so it levels up and gains abilities faster, probably one with stealth jump for slayers, one with object shredder for weapons that need it vs armor, one with ink saver main for ink hungry weapons, you get the picture.

Reefslider : Increases paint and explosion radius (+20%)

Zipcaster : Decreases ink drain per hook (-62.5%) and passive ink drain (-20%). (Zipcaster has it's own ink tank, once depleted the special ends)

Tri Strike : Increases throw range (+30%)

S2 Specials is the same as before. Storm gives throw and duration, inkjet is paint, explosion and duration, missiles is targeting size and paint, booyah is passive charge, stamp is duration.

15uvsj2,jwsbbpe,Narrow-Bicycle6196,"The game got faster due to Inkjet and, as a result, Cooler becoming prominent and Ballpoint just so happens to be a backline with Inkjet. It also deals better with displacement than Liter since it isn't as slow",2023-08-18 22:45:04
15uvsj2,jwtzbkl,wintersele,"Crab was what initially pushed e-liter out of the meta; one of the reasons you'd see multiple crabs early on is that you can reliably have a crab to serve as a backline when you need one while still having a splash with burst bombs to push up and take fights, something the e-liter struggles with. Crabs also kill chargers faster than chargers kill crabs (unless the charger lands a headshot, which is only possible from certain angles), so the e-liter lost in multiple ways during crab meta.

Crab meta began to diminish as several other specials were buffed to be better at dealing with crabs, and several kits added which put those specials on stronger main weapons than they had at launch, so while it is still a very valuable special (especially on certain maps and modes), it's no longer effectively required, since there is a lot more counterplay. But a special which is good at dealing with crab is usually just as good at dealing with a charger or other slow backliner.

E-liters are theoretically good at dealing with inkjet (though inkjet is also pretty good at dealing with chargers if they can catch them unprepared), but the crab hasn't gone anywhere, so not only do e-liters have to contend with the inkstrikes and trizookas and inkjets and zipcasters, the enemy team can counterpick a crab to make the enemy charger's life a lot harder. And of course tacticooler reduces the value of your charger getting individual picks, since even with respawn punisher they'll be back in no time.

The fact that inkjet is such a high priority special right now also means that your backliner is probably playing ballpoint right now; ballpoint also has a kit and main weapon that lets it play both very aggressively or stay back and play anchor, as the situation demands. Fizzies and inkjet can support your team's push a lot better than an e-liter can, so ballpoint is in considerably higher demand than e-liter most of the time.

There are also several common weapons (tetras and wipers, to name a few off the top of my head) whose mobility and kits are very good at bullying backliners and keeping them from setting up, and tacticooler also encourages very aggressive play, since the risk doesn't matter (in addition to giving everyone using it extra mobility so they're harder to hit). E-liter tends to be less valuable in countering hard aggressive comps compared to the heavy splatlings or the ballpoint; what you want to deal with aggression is the ability to quickly clear out the enemy team when they overextend, and that tends to not be the strong point of chargers.

But despite being pushed down in priority by common specials and playstyles that chargers tend not to do well against, there are still several mapmodes where e-liter is a strong pick, and several where ZF (or, after the recent inkvac buff, vanilla splat charger) is worth bringing, and in particular the popularity of splatlings makes chargers a popular pick (since chargers are in general a pretty strong counter to splatlings).",2023-08-19 07:48:20

Thus, I only consider Special Power Up when I want to experiment and get silly. If I'm doing that, I'd want to go all out on the ability. And since I'd never use Special Power Up chunks for anything serious, instead of letting them collect dust, I'd dump the 30 chunks into this.

If you want to save that 1 space for a utility sub, I think you're better off using any other shirt that already has Special Power Up as the main and then utilizing the other 3 slots for 3 utility subs instead of 1.

That said, I'm not sure any of them need 19 AP for their specific purposes. You should look into what weapons you like to play that have specials that actually get a meaningful benefit from SPU and see how much SPU you need to get that meaningful benefit.

For example, wavebreaker has certain breakpoints of SPU that increase its radius enough to get major value out of the AP, like being able to place the wavebreaker behind cover and still reaching the entirety of a splat zone, or hitting a common backliner position from behind cover. But this is heavily map dependent, and 19 AP is still a lot of investment to place into just Special Power Up.

That being said, 30 chunks can be a lot.  You may want to consider the abilities you most use when swapping gear around and add one of them for 10 in that last slot.  Something like swim speed or ink resist can better lend itself to being a good loadout building tool.  It kinda depends on the rest of your gear setup and what you tend to play.

mx2i0f,gvn9kwk,HiroProtagonest,"> The only thing is that it kinda sucks against backlines. If you have lethal bombs and chuck it at a Hydra Splatling they have to swim away from the bomb

You're starting to get it, but I don't think you grasp the level of difference here.

A quick toss to put out a lethal threat - with some paint - is almost like adding another player to your team. Toxic Mist can do maybe 20% of the things a bomb can in a critical moment for like 90% of the ink cost, with none of the general map control - and that map control is kind of extremely important for dealing with enemies who outrange you. If you place a splat bomb correctly, it has the same effect you're getting from mist by restricting movement - you might have to react to them moving one way, but they can't move the other way without dying. Splat bomb also paints and can independently get a kill. As a Ttek (the obvious competition to Splash), a fair bit of the match is spent throwing splat bombs, it's such an important way to extend your threat range. You can be swimming from one area to another and be like, oh, let me toss a bomb real quick. Mist does nothing if you do that. For such little time invested, even with the ink cost, I'll say it again, *a bomb is almost like adding another player to your team.*",2021-04-24 03:50:07

Edit: If not Ink Storm I think I would have given the kit either Zipcaster or Ink Jet. The dodge roll is good counter to people camping your jump spot and Zipcaster loves a deadly short range weapon.

Do you think you could? I’m not familiar with the weapon or why it’s skyrocketed in popularity. I’m pretty terrible with fizzy bombs, just too much to think about, so I usually avoid them.

xpsd4h,iq5xh91,127-0-0-1_1,"Squeezer + .52 gal - these were the absolute kings of Splatoon 2's last meta, and they're fairly untouched. .52 gal is arguably worse now that it doesn't have booyah bomb but it was the very best weapon in Splatoon 2 by the end, so being worse is a good thing for everyone else.

Squeezer still has insane stats, and its kit is different but also very good; wall to keep itself alive, abuse its range, and trizooka is considered the best special in the game by pros right now.

On Dualies: all the dualies did get buffed from the lack of damage up and no ink armor. That being said, Dapple Dualies are still the worse ones - a strong main weapon, but it got a support's kit. Splat dualies are just outclassed by the other dualies.

Squelcher is probably the overall best dualies, and one of the best weapons, but it's also pretty weird for a dualie. Tetras are the best traditional, in-your-face, slayer dualies. 

Splattershot is very strong in the game.

N-Zap is on its own a very good weapon still. The meta isn't great for it, but in the right meta tacticooler is a menace and it's still the same N-Zap that dominated in splatoon 2 otherwise.

All of the chargers got heavily buffed indirectly in this game as well. Less displacement specials, no ink armor is a good time. Splat charger is particularly strong. e-liter is still good despite its kit sucking.

- 2nd off is your mpu, while more damage is always good 1 pure of mpu is no where near max damage for tetras. People often use 1 main and 1 sub of mpu on tetras because it gets it to 30 damage, allowing it to 1shot armor.

- 3rd off is what we call ""utility subs."" Generally people will run at least 1 sub of ink resistance, bomb defense dx, and quick superjump as they help with movement and to help you die less. I would replace 2 of your mpu subs with a bomb defense dx sub and a quick super jump sub

1b0z1t6,ksbf3ol,Nkyaxs,"For upgrading your gear, go to [Murch](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Murch#Splatoon_3) in front of the lobby in the overworld. He's to the left of the entrance. He provides the ability to upgrade gear, put gear abilities on your gear, etc. 

To unlock all 3 slots in a piece of gear, you either need to encounter that gear in the shop again, and you can pay money to increase the level, or you go to Murch and use a sea snail to increase the level. At 2 stars, the gear slots are fully unlocked, and any additional levels only serve to increase the speed at which it rolls empty slots (basically isn't worth it past 2 stars). 

[Abilities](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Gear_ability#Splatoon_3). The best abilities change depending on the weapon/role. Swim Speed is typically the most universal and very common on nearly every weapon. There are probably videos or other threads that go into greater detail.

To put abilities on a piece of gear, you will need ability chunks, which you can get by [scrubbing gear](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Murch#Scrub_slots_2) (at Murch) with money or, most efficiently, from grinding Salmon Run rewards. Whichever method you choose, this is fairly tedious and unless you play a lot, its unlikely you will have an excess of ability chunks to do whatever you want. However, its worth noting that gear ability isn't so important that its absolutely necessary to win games, so you don't really need to sweat it that much (unless of course, you're hyper-competitive). Just let it come naturally.

Splat Roller is typically considered an aggressive weapon that sharks for kills, but you can play it however you want really. For rollers that are considered more supportive, Flingza, Big Swig, and Dynamo fit the role better. All are more focused on painting and zone control, with Dynamo especially so, being a dedicated backliner.",2024-02-27 02:26:36
1b0z1t6,ksbf6os,HabituallyLewd,"Okay, from the top.

You get 3 slots by using Sea Snails, which you get from Splatfests. 1 Sea Snail unlocks an extra slot.

To get what you want, you need chunks. 10 chunks for a single ability, + 10 chunks for every subsequent slot of the same ability. So if you want 3 Swim Speeds on a piece of gear where it has none to start, you’d need 60 chunks, 30 if you want 2 and 10 if you want 1. A good way to avoid this is to put 1 Swim Speed on each piece of gear, effectively granting you the same boost, but halving your cost. You get chunks from playing Salmon Run, and from scrubbing gear that has the ability you want. Scrubbing removes that ability from that gear and gives you 1 chunk for each sub ability on that gear.

Abilities that benefit the Splat Roller is Swim Speed, Ninja Squid (Shirt only), Stealth Jump (shoes only), a hefty amount of quick super jump, and then 1 sub each of Special Saver and Ink Resistance Up.

Those last 3 are staples. In almost any build meant for competitive play, you’re very likely to see 1 sun each of Super Jump, Ink Res, and Special Saver.",2024-02-27 02:27:07
1b0z1t6,ksb9gb9,Deja_Vu75,"Well roller is more of a slayer weapon, some good players run ninja squid and invest in swim speed, but I like to run QSJ so you can retreat and enter battles really fast. It’s all up to you, because most weapons are “good”",2024-02-27 01:50:47

For competitive help: Youtubers like Prochara and Squidschool and good resources. Some of their older videos/playlists will give you a good understanding of the game.

1b0z1t6,kseptfh,Wamekugaii,"Besides what other people have said, as for the play style… splat roller is a very aggressive weapon. There are better support “rollers” imo.

The way you use splat roller is entry, get picks, escape from a bad situation using quick super jump. To escape quickly, remember the most backline weapon on your team. Open the map and you’ll see a D-pad option. (The plus sign buttons). Click on any of those plus sign buttons and you’ll see it automatically goes to a selected team mate. 

Remember which plus side button the backline of your team is and escape to them when you’re quick super jumping. To escape even better, hold down the D-pad button, then quickly press X then A. 

So (TeammateD-PAD>X>A). 

You’ll jump before you even see the map.

1b0z1t6,kske2x9,NeonWyvern,"This doesn't answer your exact question, but... it seems like you're just starting to learn the game (based on the fact you don't know about upgrading gear). My suggestion is to usually not concern yourself with winning and just concern yourself with having fun and learning what all the specials and weapon classes do, and discovering the mechanics for yourself while becoming intimate with the controls.

But you mention you're trying to learn the game to support your Esports team. In that case, I highly recommend the YouTube channel Squid School. Nowadays, he mostly does short guides for high level players, but he also makes videos about the mindset of teamplay. His ""Getting Out of _ Rank"" video series was made in Splatoon 2, but is still relevant to Splatoon 3: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlqxull1Xs9SvT9ojx-C6oRRgNBXTY6j7&si=nJge_Mh7ZN4AeUMr.

1b0z1t6,ksbrumn,musicmadness957,"hello! so basically, every weapon has different gear “chunks” (what you call slots) that help them the best. sendou.ink is a good resource to find out which chunks help what- you can look at different “builds” (an outfit with the desired chunks) for whatever weapon you want to customize. every article of clothing has a brand- each brand has chunks they favor, and chunks they disfavor. [here is a website specifying which brands do what.](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Gear_brand)the only way to get chunks is by playing with gear with empty slots (has a question mark). a second way is to use super sea snails to reroll a brand with filled slots, but imo that’s a waste of super sea snails. 
you get super snails by playing in splatfests, which happen every now and then and are scheduled. you pick a team, if your team wins you get extra, but it’s mostly based on how much you play in that particular splatfest. additionally, if your gear has less than 3 slots, you increase it with super sea snails. you also raise the star power with super sea snails, which makes the gear more powerful. 
you can add specific chunks to gear by grinding until you get ten of that ability, which you can then add. you can increase your likelihood of getting chunks by drinking the drinks in the lobby (that funky looking lady in the corner over by the vending machine). it is quite a grind. i find it to be more efficient to try to play for chunks on gear i like (with the drink effect) and then replace the chunks i don’t like with 10 chunks i’ve grinded for. 
there’s also primary and secondary abilities. primary is more powerful, that’s the bigger circle. you need 45 to replace a primary ability. however, some primaries consist of a variety of abilities. those are more powerful, and easier to get. it gives effects like ninja squid like you were talking about. if you go to murch, who is just outside of the entrance to the lobby, he should explain some of this also. i should have put that earlier- you change all of this with murch . let me know if you have any other questions, hope you can help your kiddos!

Very similar thing happened earlier with splashdowning then running right into their ink storm.

There was another time where the tri-slosher was just suddenly at your side attacking you because you were too far in. Some other times you seemed too far in but just didn't get punished for it. Meanwhile, sometimes you just seemed to hang back a little too much to throw fizzies? Your main weapon still paints more if you don't have a reason to be using the range.

mp6x12,gu99pmv,h8bearr,"Only watched the first game, but I noticed you almost never harassed the two curved perches when you had control of the zone. I always make a point to keep those access points painted so it's harder to fire from and retake. Don't linger, but you get the idea.

On several occasions, you should have painted the vertical wall surrounding the center wavy platform that contains the zone. You chose to walk all the way around instead of just sloshing directly in front of you and climbing into the platform.

You also never once tried the forward flank around the northeast corner when you were in possession. You're a slayer weapon, so you should try to keep the front pressure high when they're on the back foot.

1) I’m guessing the MPU isn’t doing much. I think the slosher will still be a 2HKO without it. Inkipedia isn’t clear on how it works exactly (just says increase damage from higher grounds). MPU is only worth it if it can bring weapons close to 99.9% with fewer hits. Consider getting comeback if you’re fighting at the main lines and trading or dying a lot.

2) Do you really need stealth swim? I think it’s best for ambush weapons (like rollers or short-range blasters). But I defer to your call on that since I don’t play slosher. If you got rid of it, I’d consider special charge up or run speed / swim speed.

3) always have 1 sub of defense (it brings inkjet from 2 indirect shots to 3) and 1 sub of ink res, and at least 1 sub of QSJ (which you have already). All these get a significant bump having one and you don’t need more than that",2021-03-04 14:13:15

If you're more interested in cutting your MPU, my advice is to cut the Run Speed as it does essentially nothing because of Pro's run speed multiplier.

112dw15,j8lyoed,MaSaHoMaKyo,"Have you compared how this plays to other builds? For example, with vs without ninja squid, or getting a main of special charge in there for better special output? There’s also some valuable one-of or two-of stuff that you may find gives you more benefit than that much sub saver - e.g. a single sub of ink res goes a very long way towards not getting stuck on the edges of enemy ink with a 10 frame window before it starts to affect you, or special saver which gives you a fairly big bump for the first sub.

I don’t play vjr, but my mains are ttek and cjr so I do have a little hands-on time with the jr main weapon and with splat bombs. I tend towards a fairly passive playstyle with both, focusing on subs for low risk poking, keeping paint around places where my team will fight, and outputting a lot of specials. I find LDE to be excellent for that, and special charge I really like on the cjr because it really helps get more specials over the course of a match, but also to get them back quickly after dying to get a good re-push. Personally I really like ninja squid on both weapons. The jr may not be the best fighting weapon ever but it’s extremely mobile and I firmly believe that if you’re never using that mobility and decent time-to-splat to play aggressively then you’re not getting the full potential out if the weapon, particularly in solo queue where you have no control over team composition and may have to fill in for a gap in fighting power if e.g. your team has a bunch of backline and support weapons. Small amounts of ink res and special saver also help aggressive play when you do so.",2023-02-15 07:40:34

1 - Play Salmon Run so you get Drinks and Chunks.

4 - Every time you get the second ability unlock, if neither of them are what you want, scrub it immediately.

5 - If you get to the third unlock and two of the abilities are what you want, you can finish it off with chunks.  If not, scrub and try again.

Additionally, you can use [https://leanny.github.io/splat3seedchecker/](https://leanny.github.io/splat3seedchecker/) to track your gear's RNG and therefore know when to use a drink that will result in the rolls you want.

Being able to swim back and keep the right distance is essential. You live or die by the ability to stay at the perfect range. So I personally wouldn't even touch ninja squid with the squiffer. Even though its arguably the strongest perk in the game, it decreases the very thing that squiff needs the most (imo).

I run 2 mains of swim speed and I actually like having quite a bit of ink saver main. LDE also a good option but I never find myself spamming the sub so I've leant towards:

2x mains of Swim speed up
1x main of ink saver main

I personally don't think ninja squid is useful for squiffer, but I guess it mostly depends on your playstyle. I go the opposite way and put at least 1 main of SSU in order to give me more escapability from sticky situations. More swim speed is immensely helpful for a squiffer, mobility is everything. 

Same with LDE, you don't really have a spammable bomb secondary on the current S3 squiffer kit, so I wouldn't use LDE. You'll get some benefit but another ability would be more useful. 

If you die a lot, some Special saver would be nice, or special charge up if you die less.

xhan6l,ip8ngal,laskodi,"My current main. I've been running it almost exclusively in TW and found a steady rhythm of how to use it.

First off, spam horizontal shots to get tenta missiles up, and fire them off immediately. Best case, I get a few splats right off the bat from our base. I find I can usually get another super charged by the time I engage.

At that point, I hang behind our front line, tossing curling bombs to test for safety, and backpedaling/spamming jump shots any time I get engaged 1v1. 

Jumping to get the vertical shot makes it pretty dead accurate, and I've gotten some satisfying 1h kills from on top of central towers with a jumping charged shot.",2022-09-20 20:15:47

Your almost never going to win a at sight one on one with a shooter, they will almost always put power you. Instead, flank people from behind or the sides.

xhan6l,ipoch6m,Alastor-Ghoul,"I quite like it.  Its main strength is it is good at covering turf very quickly because of the triple shot aspect and it has a pretty good fire rate.  The main issue with it is its uncharged attack barely does anything to deal damage.  But if you nail an enemy with a direct full charged attack, you can one shot them which with as fast paced of a game as it is, is easier said than done.  However, if you nail the enemy with a charged attack, it can knock them down low enough on health to kill them with one or two uncharged attacks.  Its sub helps with sneaking up on people which in general is helpful but is even more helpful for charge weapons.  It also has a really good support special.  I find tenta missiles to be one of the better specials in general for this reason.  A combination of fast ink coverage with tenta missiles will allow you to spam tenta missiles pretty frequently.  When you are frequently firing off tenta missiles you are already contributing quite a bit for your team.  You won't typically get high kill counts with this weapon, but on a standard good match you will have a lot of points and a decent amount of assist kills.  It's a legitimately good weapon imo, but it is a support weapon, so if you are not used to using support weapons there will be a learning curve.  In terms of good gear abilities for it I would probably recommend around 4 ink saver subs, because you probably won't use your sub that much with this weapon, but if you use it at all you probably need at least 3, but I would still recommend 4.  In general, you will probably want some ink saver mains also, because that is a pretty standard ability that every weapon needs at least to some degree imo.  Idk how much you will really need for it.  Not necessarily a lot, because it isn't really an ink hog, but it still would be good to probably run 3-5 of them.  Since a lot of the benefit of this weapon comes from its ability to ink quickly and spam its good support special it is advisable to use several special charge ups, 2-3 special savers, and possibly comeback for one of your big abilities.",2022-09-24 03:16:12

If reaching S was important enough to ensure they got carried there, they're probably aware that they're not going to get far in Solo Queue afterward. If Player Y mostly got carried to S, then they were effectively playing in S Rank lobbies anyway and did enough to not outright lose games for their team like they're being accused of doing in Solo Queue. The +5/-4 scoring is as much of a benefit to better players climbing S than it is to Player Y staying in S. A system that pushes Player Y out of S just makes the climb for the better players ever slower and doesn't necessarily preclude Player Y from ending up in the same lobbies.

Your grind from S to S+ is largely similar to the experience of players at the same skill level as you. It sucks. But purging players from S who don't deserve to be there isn't going to significantly change that.

With that out of the way, we can finally talk about the actual scoring system. Could it be changed to better measure skill and create a more even playing field? Yes, absolutely. And I would advocate for such a thing. So would most players. But it's largely irrelevant to what you want out of all of this.

If you halted rank to all of Squad, then players who prefer organized team play would feel misrepresented, and if you made rank change applicable for all levels of players in Squad, there's nothing to stop accusations of being carried to S+. The absolute fairest thing to do would be to have a Squad rank independent of Solo rank, with your rank for one of the other only showing up in the corresponding lobbies.

Of course some players will get carried to S.  This happens in SO many other games, but who cares? we play these games with the knowledge that other people are going to be terrible and get carried.

3krrnx,cv2hp06,Hitzel,"A solution that makes Team Queue worse is **unacceptable**.

Let's be real.  In every team shooter ever, Solo Queue has been stupid.  Nothing will make it as good as you want it to be.  We can improve it slightly though.

The first step in solving the problem simply splits Solo and Team Queues into two separate ranks, and just shows the higher of the two on players' public profiles.

A further step forward is to give unique squads a unique collective rank in Team Queue a'la Starcraft and other well-done ranking systems.  This way, Frank, Tiffany, Bob and I are ranked separately than my actual competitive team.  I don't need to worry about losing my rank when playing with arbitrary friends, players getting carried won't get put into lobbies they don't deserve, and the matchmaking system will do a better job at matching teams that do equally well as collective entity and not based on individual performance in a separate metagame.

Note that Solo Queue will still be stupid because it's ****ing Solo Queue.  It's not going to magically get people working together with you or knowing what you're thinking, and it's not going to stop sub-optimal play from working better than legitimate strategy because disorganization is easy to exploit in ways that will never work in a real game.

3krrnx,cv85v0j,aviynw,"Agreed.  There is such a big range in skill when you play in S ranked lobbies.  You also don't even get more or less points by having someone who is S+ on your or the opposing team.  The average S+ player is hell of a lot better than the the average S player because it so easy to get carried into s and so hard to get to s+ (Once you get to S80 you need a 66%+ win rate to rank up).  Like you, I think the ranking system in s/s+ is broken.  I think it worked perfectly fine in the lower ranks, and I see no reason they had to change it for the higher ranks.

But honestly, I find there is less of a skill range in solo queue then there is in squad battles, so I find squad battles even more frustrating.  Maybe it doesn't bother you because you are always in the winning team, but I don't usually play on a super-coordinated team and I don't enjoy stomping on a noob team one round and then getting demolished by an organized competitive team the next.  

I would much rather only play private battles all the time, but it seems a number of people on the teamspeak we play on, Ultramus, actually prefer squad battles.  Idk, I haven't been pushing for it so much recently.  When there are 8 people on I'm going to try pushing for some private battles more.  Skill consistency aside, in any game, I've always enjoyed competing against my friends than against strangers.",2015-09-20 19:12:56
3krrnx,cv9bpck,ELIMINADO,"I think you're mistaken about an S player being able to carry a squad alone.

C and B ranks are not great players. When I played Rainmaker squads with my C friend, I could not carry. I was the only one on the team doing anything worthwhile, with 20+ splats, but I just couldn't complete the whole objective on my own, especially when my teammates would keep taking the Rainmaker and losing it.

Maybe it would have been easier if it were a mode other than Rainmaker. I imagine I probably could have carried a Tower Control or Splat Zones match on my own in that lobby.

I'm an A+ now because I lost my S rank, but I played solo all the way there. I only ever tried squads for the first time after reaching S, and even then that was only once and I pretty much always play solo. You're right though that it's actually kind of difficult to rank down from S, since the 4-5 point system drags it out for much longer. You have to really go on a bad losing streak, like I did.",2015-09-21 19:15:55

lpqii2,gol53sk,Hitzel,"Do you know what build Kiver used?

There was a point long ago where I used 83 in tournaments and scrims and it exceeded expectations, even though it's ultimately not that strong.  I originally started using it because I was looking for a good weapon to run Ink Resist on the combat the MPU Kpros and L3s that were dominating the meta (pre-nerf) at the time.  Zap seemed like the best fit because of how much it paints its own feet ─ combine that with Ink Resist and Run Speed and you have a very combat-mobile weapon that's resistant to the 99.9 damage combos I was looking to beat.  83 stood out for its ability to lay down the paint even more than 85 while also not having anti-synergy between Ninja Squid and Armor, as I very much like Ninja Squid when it comes to a build that's supposed to do well in combat (it makes a mobile weapon even harder to track in a 1v1).

The playstyle for that kind of build comes together pretty nicely.  You simply get as stubborn as possible about paint control where your team needs it, and when you can't make progress an Inkstorm naturally builds itself to make up for the lack of a bomb.  With all that paint control, you're able to pick and choose your fights pretty liberally because of your Ninja Squid in that lake of paint, and when you do fight you're incredibly tricky to hit if your movement is clean.

The ""niche"" isn't really there nowadays ─ CDS doesn't succumb to a Zap in a 1v1 as easily as a Kpro or L3 does.  There's also the question if 83 is actually better than 85 at this kind of anti-MPU role in the first place.  While armor does betray your Ninja Squid in a 1v1, you should be doing fine in a 1v1 because of your Armor anyway so who cares?  In the end I think that you can probably just run 85 instead, but if you actually get a feel for the subtle advantages 83 can provide you can pick it on the fly vs a team in a tournament or scrim for that particular set.  I suspect that's what Kiver did ─ he picked 83 because he felt it had a niche advantage vs what he was fighting at the time and doesn't think it's something that is normally better.  Could be wrong though.

\*Edit\*

As for the 89 vs 83 debate in the comments, I think that 89 is generally considered to be the worst of the 3.  While it's not as terrible as solo queue kids make it seem, it's directly outclassed by Mini by almost every metric.  At least 83 is differentiated enough from Zink to fill slightly different niches.",2021-02-24 14:51:27

j4v6tr,g7n7btw,Sora_hishoku,"Looks pretty good overall and all the abilities have a purpose, so it's entirely fine to leave it like that, but the lack of sub saver is a bit odd to me, though that's prolly preference

However, with a backline playstyle in mind, I'd either switch out the shoes for a pure of iss, since ink res/bomb def isn't that relevant as a backliner that doesn't take damage too often, though removing object shredder means that you need two hits to shred armor or two burst indirects, which makes you more team-dependent. To avoid that, the tradeoff could be the 3 subs on the shows+1s of mpu and 1s of sub range up

Though still, I don't know if it's super necessary to play iss in the first play, though back when I ""mained"" it (2018/19) it was one of my go-to abilities

Keep in mind if you are just picking up the weapon that your build focusses heavily on the main/sub weapon, but the reason most top players are picking it up right now is because it can spam ray with a shitton of special charge, it's countered by other backliners and strongly ream-dependent to work outside of that",2020-10-04 08:13:20

Different gear brands are more (favoured), less (unfavoured) or sorta neutrally likely on what abilities they’ll roll. You can see which brands favour/unfavour certain abilities [here](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Brand). Any abilities not mentioned are neutral, and the chances of rolling favoured, unfavoured and neutral abilities can be found [here](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Ability).

Then, use tickets for the ability you’re interested in. These further increase the likelihood of rolling that ability. You can get tickets in Salmon Run and a few in single player (though Salmon Run is better because the single player ones are single-use and they’re not as common and easy to collect).

One other thing that’s good to take in mind is using 1 or 2 star gear. These pieces of gear require less points to fill up, though you’d have to go to Murch to add slots which a surprising amount of people don’t know and it requires Sea Snails (which aren’t too hard to come by if you’ve been playing since the last Splatfest, as you get Snails for Splatfest performance and for levelling up each time starting from Level 50).

grs82p,fs2kegi,Chuks_K,"Over the past couple months I’ve got into the vanilla .96 (the one with armour). Can get armour pretty fast (often get it in the first 15 secs of a game) and being a two-shot kill it can easily pick off those who you outrange (and with its range, it can do that very often). Despite being a 2-shot, MPU is very necessary as with enough of it you can one-shot people who have taken a bit of damage. I normally use 29+ which gets me well over 70.

Squeezer is mainly used by people with *really* good aim and discipline towards the weapon. It’s rather hard to pick up, but it’s possible. One notable player who mains/plays it often is Chocopero (ちょこぺろIGN/YT) who has been getting in Top 100 almost every month.

I like to run a fair amount of MPU on my Squelchies, anywhere between 20-40ish AP. The rest is often Swim Speed, a bit of ISMain, a little QR, sometimes Special Charge. I feel that the Squelchies allow you to run more of whatever you want really, as opposed to other weapons that I play (Zap loves Special Charge and I also use 3 subs of BDX and about 13 AP of Special Power, I use a lot of SPU for ttek as well as MPU, Comeback, QR so not as much freedom compared to Squelchies).",2020-05-28 08:58:10

NZAP is still great on Tower Control since the tower moves a lot slower and therefore calls for less speed and more fighting.

If you're going to be playing competitive and not just ranked, then the Custom Dualie Squelchers are much better than their vanilla counterpart simply because of the sheer difference in utility between bombs vs. point sensor.

As other people have already said, Foil Squeezer is an incredibly solid, but difficult support weapon. Tapping ZR pver and over shakes the controller a tiny bit, which really messes with aiming.

Main power up is definitely great on Dualie Squelchers, since its DPS isn't exactly the greatest. Other than that, though, there isn't really much to recommend besides the 1 sub each of bomb defense, quick super jump, and ink resistance (I think someone else already went into detail about these).

g1bxsq,fnf91gt,Antarcticade,"Your only stacking low teir abilities, honestly most of these abilities you only need a sub of, and with the weapon your using it's not even worth it.

You only need 1 sub of special saver, but because the dualies can usually charge up splashdown pretty fast, and it's been said 1,000 times before but usually in higher levels of play people will be able to shoot you down, or be able to evade it, it's really not worth it. 

You only need 1 sub of bomb defense up for you to get most out of it, and I would only run it if your weapon had ink armour

Again you only need 1 sub of ink recovery for it to be effective, and that's only if your using really ink thirsty weapons.

I would also only run 1 to 2 subs of quick super jump, because it's important to get back into the game ASAP after dying, but run no more then 2 subs.

Abilities you should actually use:
Swim speed up, dualies are already pretty mobile on land so being able to swim fast will also help you out

Comeback and quick Respawn, as a frontline slayer you will die a lot, and sometimes when you die you won't be able to kill consistently, especially with the dualies short range, you might just get sniped or get killed unexpectedly, so respawning fast will help that, and comeback will give you a temporary buff after respawning.

Also try just a little of ink resistance and ink saver main if you dodge roll a lot, as rolling into enemy ink isn't fun, and neither is not having enough ink to roll.

Also consider ninja squid, it's common misconception that it's only effective towards rollers, however any frontline weapon can use it and it'll be effective. They won't see you coming and being sneaky is important.

You could also run haunt, but not Respawn punisher as Respawn punisher is only really worth it for backline players who don't die a lot. However haunt will give you the ability to see the person who killed you after you Respawn, removing the whole element of being sneaky for them, and if you kill the person you were haunting, the effects of Respawn punisher will apply to them, but if the same person kills you twice, then you'll get Respawn punished, so be careful about that.

fof6zd,flfj6rp,bojilly,I personally do not like tenacity because that requires you to be alive and pretty much hope that your teammates are out there dying. Compared to special charge up there’s really no competition in my opinion. Also I would have ink recovery up instead of quick respawn since it only works if you don’t get a splat in the time that you’re alive. I’m not the best at this but this is what I would do.,2020-03-25 03:46:13

Thx bro! BooYah!",2020-03-26 08:34:26
fmodya,fl5h58i,ELIMINADO,"No, not at all


First, tenacity is awful. Like actually really bad. It used to be an option for backliners and very few other weapons, but it was decided that special charge up was a far better option, as the most you'd get out of tena was around 20p iirc, and that was pretty rare in itself.


Secondly, do not invest abilities into splashdown. It's one of the most situational, and therefore pretty terrible specials in the game. 80% of the time you use it any anything but extremely low level, you'll get shot down immediately and sent straight back to spawn, so it's a great idea to train and focus yourself to use it less to secure kills. It's kmachine's downfall, and the weapon itself would be absoloutely broken had it any other special. And no, splashdown off spawn is not worth it.


Third, red zap is completely outclassed in every conceivable way by kensa splattershot. Most agree there's little point to using it. Really.


Next, qr on hydra? What are you doing with it? I've got nothing against experimental playstyles but I don't think standing in enemy spawn all game is your best option. Qr is best used on slayer weapons (more on that later). As well as that, it's generally agreed that it's inefficient to use any less than 1 main 1 sub/4 subs of qr.


Ok, so general advice from here. 


Don't use the same gear for multiple weapons. It is extremely rare for a case where multiple weapons, especially those of different classes, can effectively use the same build.


On top of that, it's a good idea, if you're a serious player, to pick one playstyle (between Backline (long range), Midline support (usually but not always medium range and paint/slayer support-focused), midline slayer (medium range weapons that kill slower than short range weapons but are still kill orientated) and frontline slayer (short range stuff like splattershot and dualies)) and stick to it. You can also flex to whatever's meta at the time, but it's a good idea to gain fundamentals on each playstyle first.


Don't use pures, there's something called ""value subs"", these consist of, but are not limited to, quick super jump, ink resistance up, bomb defense up, special saver, swim speed up. These subs are usually, but not always, most effective in low amounts, so usually 1 or 2 subs. Using pures doesn't allow you to use these abilities, which can be a crucial help to your goal as a player. Most of the abilities you've picked are also not optimal for the weapons you've picked, which can sometimes be detrimental for your performance ingame.


For questions, I find it's easier to refer people elsewhere than type out more paragraphs (but by all means if you need some short questions answered just reply). If you have discord (if not, register an account if you can) then the perfect place for new players at the moment is [The Inkademy](https://discordapp.com/invite/wyMjCHd). There's arguably the biggest group of helping competitive splatoon players available, and a lot of people on hand to answer enquires. I'm sorry for this info dump, or if I ever came off rude at any point. I don't want you to feel like what is optimal is the only option, but since you came to a competitive sub I expected you'd want some competitive advice.

fmodya,fl627jg,Burninizer,"It pains me to see a zero run speed, zero ink resistance Splatling build.  No, the abilities are a very poor choice; the only abilities up there that I agree with are quick respawn for KMachine and only because it’s a slayer weapon (and I personally think QR is worthless, but top players disagree with me).

Briefly, because it’s been said before, tenacity is bad in Splatoon 2 and is outclassed by special charge up.  Orange N-Zap is outclassed by KShot.  Sub power up is garbage on all three of those weapons.  Nothing about ANY of those abilities work with Hydra except tenacity, and again, special charge up.  You should make sets for each weapon, because you’ll never find a “one size fits all” build for every weapon, let alone when you account for every mode AND every map because those should affect your build as well.",2020-03-22 04:42:00

fmodya,fl605b1,bojilly,"It’s pretty eh I think. I’m not very knowledgeable when it comes to kits for weapons, but I do know if you splat an enemy quick respawn will not work and these are all pretty mid to back line weapons pretty much guaranteeing you at least one splat. I personally don’t like tenacity as much as I do special charge up, it’s just kinda eh in my opinion. If you have a dc it might help a bit but based off of the weapons you’re playing I’d go for ink resistance or run speed up (especially for heavy splatling). I would personally not have that much special power up for those specials, but that’s just me. I would switch those out with quick super jump, and if you don’t like to super jump switch out tenacity for stealth jump or drop roller depending on what you prefer. On a lighter note I do like your style especially with the kensa sloshing machine, but it kinda clashes with the n zap 89 lol.",2020-03-22 04:13:23
fmodya,fl6l045,Sora_hishoku,"I can't see how people legitimately say the set is ""okay"" at any cost.

Firstly, those three weapons are entirely different and require different abilities.
Secondly, the basic universal abilities are missing. (Ink resistance, special saver<not missing but wanted to list anyways>, quick superjump, bomb defense, ink recovery)
Thirdly, the abilities you use have little to no effect for most of the time.

Tenacity - it's okay-ish for Hydra. Since as a backliner you don't usually die a lot (or you are doing something wrong). However, using tenacity means not doing any mistakes at all and playing super securely to have it's effect be worth it.
Tl;dr special charge up is better.

For O-Zap(even if you shouldn't use this weapon in the first place) it's terrible. Zap is a short range weapon and a frontline support. You are gonna die a lot. Despite, you shouldn't invest abilities into tenta missiles.

For kSloshing it's the same as for zap. Splashdown is pretty bad most of the time and when you do want to use it it's very predictable and any decent backliner will delete you.

Next, Quick respawn.
As I said before, backliners shouldn't die often. And if they do, they usually get a kill or an assist before they do meaning qr won't activate. A wadter 3 slots.

Zap is a support and gets assists too meaning qr won't activate so, it's not quite worth it but it's not the worst sub to run on it because a useless weapon can't be made good with any sub abilities really

On kSloshing qr is great, you often get into situations where your weapon gets outpaced or you can't back up fast enough, so you die a lot and often without taking one with you. You can even run a lot more of it.

Special saver: it does count as one of the essential sub abilities, but two things, Splashdown and missiles aren't great so it's not needed and you can use the empty slot for something else. So the Hydra benefits the most from it. However, it's too much nonetheless and you should reduce it to be like 1/2 subs.

Special power up: bad on all except Hydra, tho missiles benefit from it to some extent too. I would personally run it if I have troubles deciding what else to run, maybe.

Ink saver main: great on sloshing, might be a little much(I'm not a sloshing player so i don't know) but bad on the other two, entirely. Hydra and zap have great ink efficiency. The amount of extra shots you get is low.

Sub range up: complete garbage, like, really. Mines get like 2% range buff only for the detector, fizzy and autobomb get a throwing range buff which is not needed at all considering how low there own range is. possibly not as bad as I am saying on zap if you play it really supportively but you need extraordinary gamesense for that.

What you SHOULD run;
Hydra: lot of run speed, a little swim speed, some more ink resistance, special charge up, the common subs(as stated above) and 2-subs of quick super jump.

kSloshing: ink saver main, run speed, qr, the common subs (minus the special saver), swim speed, depending on play style squid ninja and stealth jump.

O-zap: well, anything really. This weapon makes no sense to play. No ability can save you from throwing every game you enter with it. 

For Zap'85 however; special charge, few special power, special saver, ink saver sub, the common subs, possibly some run speed for 1v1s (in which you should not get as a support)",2020-03-22 10:41:54

fmodya,fl6hgo5,PrebuiltMangos,"atling is an anchor/support while NZap is close up slayer, two very differwnt styles that probably need different outfits. Tentacity is like ... the worst? It works better when you lose and thats not something you want to be happening. Quick respawn is great for a slayer but being an anchor weapon like a splatling should mean you're not dying. Same goes for Special Saver, although that makes more sense for a splatling. For splatling, consider special charge up instead of saver and some run speed. For the nzap, id put run speed instead of tenacity and youd be golden. In my opinion",2020-03-22 09:24:24

1fcwp66,lmbkv5z,ELIMINADO,"I have a couple of points. 

1. Is your metric how good a weapon is at fighting or how aggressive it is?  Because if it’s based on how good it is at fighting, I think vanilla sploosh and vanilla clash should be reversed. If it’s based on how aggressive the playstyle is, vanilla sploosh and vanilla clash should both be in the top. Sploosh has an outrageous kill time and it’s mainly just good for super close range sharking. The vanilla kit is also super aggressive although stamp isn’t very effective. Curling isn’t inherently aggressive but the way sploosh uses it is. Either way neo clash doesn’t belong up there, it does not have an aggressive kit. I guess based on intended playstyle it belongs in flexible because of super chumps being very paint support oriented. 

2. Jr is a really solid main weapon. It has a decent kill time and insane paint. It works well as a support and can slay in a pinch. In competitive it is way higher tier than anaki nova and big swig. In terms of aggression it’s more in line with zap and splash, although it leans further on the support side. The kit is pretty balanced with bubble being useful both defensively and offensively to compensate for its slow kill time and bad accuracy. I’m also a big CJR enthusiast and while it’s not that strong rn, the location distraction and chip damage play style is super cool and if wave breaker gets the buffs it rightly deserves it could be awesome. 

3. Ink brush is a hyper aggressive weapon. That’s pretty much all it does besides cheesing clam blitz in A rank by running past the enemy with a power clam, scoring 20 points, spamming “this way” and immediately dying. 

3. I think rapids run a little bit more on the supportive side. Not a weapon I’m super familiar with though. I just know they’re very combo centered. 

4. Reflux isn’t flexible. I really, really wish it was and I LIVE for the day we see reflux get buffed into being a slayer. I really do. But as it is, it just can’t compete with top tier short range shooters, rollers and blasters and it breaks my heart 💔

That’s all that comes up for me. I like the list and it’s a super interesting format! Most of my criticisms are opinions and I’m not necessarily saying you’re wrong, just I don’t agree with it all.",2024-09-09 19:15:28

1fcwp66,lmdmpq6,L_Eggplant,"Honestly both jets should probably be in passive. Especially the custom kit.

Vanilla Jet has angle which can combo for kills but because arcing a burst bomb is a more proactive tool to displace people than angle is, I think angle cleans up fights rather than gives jet a tool to be aggro. Vac literally cant do anything without teammates assisting.

Custom is just way too passive, mist isnt like disruptor where throwing it confirms kills fast so its mostly used on jet to deny engages from enemies and its special is better used for supporting frontlines pushing. Its just not really kitted to do alot by itself. This one hurts the most I really miss burst on this and dousers just doesn’t feel the same.",2024-09-10 02:18:30

Vanilla rapid is hard to judge because nobody plays it, but I would have surely thought that vanilla rapid pro should count as a passive weapon. Rapid pro deco can also be played passively, so I would consider it flexible.

On the other hand, I don't understand what vsploosh can do without playing hyper aggressive. It has no range and the kit doesn't lean towards a special spam playstyle so it seems like the definition of a hydrogen bomb.

Blob deco has a kit that actually leans towards having a bit more aggression so I would at the very least consider it it flexible.

Also I know vunder is the worst weapon in the game, but if you are going to play it then you have to be aggressive with it. If you want to spam slider for zones cheese, then play dread. Vunder's kit is aggressive, and as bad as the weapon and kit are, it is still much better aggressive than passive.",2024-09-14 10:33:27

The weapon is very ink hungry so main saver could help with that. The sub, while not the best, is useful to be spammed if you're really struggling finding some high ground where you're not constently getting thrown bombs at. It allows to poke ennemies out and help your team clear some space for you.

That being said, Sub Saver is very useful for getting a Torpedo out in your engagements and having enough ink to reliably fight someone. Last-Ditch Effort is also just as good in general for similar reasons.

Otherwise, movement abilities... Well, Swim Speed really, is quite helpful for closing distances and strafing around, both of which the Splatanas need. Ninja Squid is very good right now as well to help go undetected so you can get in melee distance. Having said that, avoid Run Speed Up as Splatanas, like Rollers, do not get the buff while swinging.

However, I should mention that quite a few people are running Quick Respawn from the builds I saw on sendou.ink (highly recommended for any future build questions) and I suspect it's because Splatana plays better as a Skirmisher than Slayer given that its faster kill times are situational. Remember that Assists do not take away QR's bonus, so pairing up with, for example, a Splattershot player and harassing opponents so your Splattershot player can go in for Splats if very effective. Having said that, go for the kill if it presents itself.

Last 50: 32-18

Still figuring it out myself, but you're on the right track for sure from what I've been able to tell. This is what I'm currently going for: 

Main: Ink Saver - Subs: Special Gauge+ x3 

Main: Special Power Up - Subs: Special Saver - Ink Resistant - Ink Recover Up

Main: Swim Speed Up - Subs: Swim Speed Up x2 - Super Jump

My reasoning comes from first hand experience where they were noticeable.  Having a wider Tenta Missile scope has been the biggest surprise for me. Might just be coincidence, but I've been getting more splats since having it on. I can get all 4 opponents more reliably and a lot faster. Gets me back in the game that much quicker. 

Ink resistance is a must IMO. Helps out a lot, still not sure if having it as a main is worth it but having 1 seems to help a lot. 

Swim speed is another must, I thought I'd need more until I actually took a look at the numbers. I think 1 main and 2 subs is perfect before you start wasting slots. 

Ink Saver Main might just be a preference, but it's an absolute must for me. If I don't have it as a main I find myself running out way too often. 

Of course we pack one of the most busted specials in the game, so spamming missiles is always going to be good. Missiles are so good, having it as a main with 2/3 subs might even be better but I enjoy the ink recover up and special saver is great for getting your special back up n running if your team gets wiped/need to help make a push after being splatted. 

I want to like Ninja Squid but I find speed to be much more useful. At the level I'm at it doesn't seem to help me be any sneakier. My opponents can still see me, snipers can still catch you, and if you're being really sneaky you can just swim really slow and you won't make any ruffles in the paint, basically nullifying the skill anyways. If you're properly flanking and reducing your swim speed when you have to, you really don't need it. 

Overall, I think Swim Speed, Special Gauge Up and Ink Resistant are making the biggest difference and are the ""must haves"". Personally finding the Special Power Up, Quick Super Jump and Quick Super Jump very good as well and idk if I just paint too much but I've always need Ink Saver's. I'll have to check my last 50, but I'm almost positive I'm the #1 painter in every single of my matches.",2022-10-05 18:52:43

lpxf2w,goe87ty,Sora_hishoku,"so this build looks a lot like you took a look at [sendou.ink](https://sendou.ink) but don't understand the why behind each ability so I'm taking that here:

&#x200B;

LDE - really good pick but usually used with a good amount of ink saver sub for spamming a lot more bombs and being able to paint more without pause when it's active

ink res - you paint a lot so 2 subs isn't really necessary, 1 sub is good enough. it's used to counter 99.9 damage weapons like kpro or bamboo

quick respawn - not needed, it's used for weapons that die a lot but even for an aggro build you shouldn't use it in this meta unless you are a main slayer

swim speed - again, not needed for zap really, focussing on special/bombs is more important imo, but it's often used for aggressive builds that don't focus on those too much

mpu - popular because it helps paint fast imo 2 subs is better but 3 is totally fine

shredder - debatable but popular, it's good for shredding armor and such so it's a good supporting ability

special charge - it's strong to spam armor which is meta right now, using 2 subs is often the case for very aggressive builds but more supportive builds tend to run a lot more

QSJ - 1 sub is good but not normally used for a support weapon like zap

&#x200B;

to me the playstyle this build implicates is really aggressive frontline support/Skirmisher and supporting in mind but not as main goal. also I'd recommend some run speed if that is spot on because it makes strafing/dodging easier in fights",2021-02-22 22:53:57
lpxf2w,godzdzf,ELIMINADO,"quick respawn sub isn't necessary, swap it for SSU for quicker armors from spawn. LDE isn't really the most versatile thing, more of a niche pick for zones/rm. And the abilities it boosts (ink savers) won't help you turn the tide too much, and you would still need 1s of sub saver if lde was fully active for a double bomb.

jv1iks,gch2j27,LuminousGame,N-zap is generally considered better since its an aerospray with much tighter aim. You can kill much faster and just a little wave of the controller can give you just as much ink coverage.

jv1iks,gchngly,PrebuiltMangos,"Areospray isnt the worst weapon in the game, but its wide spread and high amount of shots to kill make it an inefficient weapon, (for ranked at least, where turf isn't priority)",2020-11-16 12:42:38
jv1iks,gchxjna,Woofiewoofie4,"The problem is basically that it's unreliable in combat. 'Unreliable' is probably an understatement - it can lose fights from pretty much any situation, no matter how big an advantage you think it has when engaging. The 5-shot kill combined with by far the worst accuracy in the game means its kill time can potentially by far longer than expected; essentially there's only a 52% chance that 5 successive bullets will fly straight, and that's assuming you're shooting straight out of squid form - it could be as low as *3%* if you've already been firing anything over 1 second before attacking. Which is pretty insane; you can jump someone from behind from extremely close range and still end up allowing them to escape, or even simply turn around and kill you before the Aerospray hits 5 shots.

&#x200B;

Burst Bomb on the PG does help remedy this to some extent. But then I guess we need to start looking at its competition. Jr can spam specials just as well as the Aerospray, and Ink Armor is a stronger special than any of the Aerosprays'; plus the main weapon is quite significantly better at killing (which says a lot, because it's still pretty bad). Neo Splash's Suction Bomb launcher is probably more useful than Booyah Bomb in Zones, and the main weapon is so much better that there's hardly any comparison. Sploosh is quite a different weapon apart from having low accuracy and high turf rate, but if you want to include that as competition then the Sploosh 7 is at least very well-suited to Rainmaker (and probably better at being a 'huge annoyance', as you say). So basically even though the PG isn't necessarily *terrible*, there's rarely any reason to pick it over other similar weapons.

&#x200B;

Does that mean you shouldn't use it? Of course not, use whatever you want! Plenty of players make it to X Rank at least with Aerosprays - every weapon in the game can get that far, and that's probably as far as most players care about getting anyway. There might be other weapons that do a similar job better, but that doesn't mean an Aerospray can't still contribute to the team and do well if the player uses it effectively. So if you enjoy it and it's working for you, then by all means carry on using it. :)",2020-11-16 14:35:27
jv1iks,gchycwx,Hitzel,"I wouldn't say the Gold Aesospray is the worst weapon in the game (it's really impossible to choose a worst weapon anyway), but it's certainly not very strong.

Gold Aero has two critical flaws that make it hard to justify using.  The first off is its inability to paint a *contested* area.  While the Aerospray is for sure able to output a lot of paint all at once, it is unable to consistently do so in the face of direct opposition from any slaying weapon worth it's salt.  Trying to paint in the face of a CDS for example just results in a dead Aerospray.  This means that being able to paint where the fight is, the kind of painting that actually matters, is very difficult ─ avoiding the fight to paint for Baller in the middle of nowhere actively hurts your team when an actual firefight is happening.

Once Gold Aero starts struggling to paint, which is supposed to be its primary function, its second weakness gets magnified: Aerospray is straight up bad at killing things.  There are plenty of weapons that have a primary role of painting, but the good ones have some sort of range or killing power that allows them to contest an area with paint and/or easily shift gears to a slaying role whenever needed.  Gold Areo is typically forced to use Baller in order to accomplish these basic functions expected of a support weapon, and having to burn your special like this instead of using it for takebacks or game-winning pushes tends to be a dead weight to the team.

If you are enjoying Gold Aerospray, but are looking for an upgrade that gives you more of what you're enjoying, I recommend two options:

1 - Inkbrush Nouveau:  There are weapons better at Baller spam than Gold Aero, and Inkbrush N is the weapon that feels most similar in playstyle.  The Inkbrush itself makes up for what would be the same weaknesses as Aerospray by being incredibly mobile.  It is able to attempt attacks and back off safely at will, and it is therefore able to consistently position itself to be a looming threat of a flank in ways Aerospray cannot.  It's also more consistent at killing once it gets in.  If you like being an annoyance with Gold Aero, this is a straight upgrade.

2 - Bronze Aerospray:  Bronze Aero makes up for the main weapons weaknesses with its kit.  Burst bombs, with some Sub Power Up, allow it to chunk opponents for damage when Gold would be out of options.  With teammates involved (should be common for a support weapon), this can often lead to important kills and assists that help it be more able to contest paint ─ someone who wants to disrespect the Aerospray needs to be way more careful after getting pegged for half their health and having enemy ink splashed at their feet.  Burst bombs are also good for simply making up for the main weapon's lack of killing power.  The Booyah Bomb, in similar fashion, fits more into where an Aerospray will be typically positioned.  If you are having trouble pushing the team forward, a Booyah Bomb followed up by a refreshed tank of Sub Power Burst Bombs is inevitable and will have a much larger impact on your team's ability to move forward as a unit compared to Gold Aero using Baller.  This is especially true in Tower Control.  If you like painting and being indirect with Aerospray, this is a straight upgrade.

I hold nothing against you for enjoying Gold Aerospray, but since you asked directly, no it's not a good weapon.  Keep using it if you are having fun with it.  Consider the two weapons I recommended if you want what you're doing to be more effective.  Good luck.",2020-11-16 14:43:08

gm1799,fr1b14k,David_O14,More run speed and less mpu. That last nerf made the ballpoint move alot slower while shooting or charging. Mpu increases damage on ballpoint so it's good but you probably don't need so much of it. I use 9 subs of run speed on any splattling other than the nautilus. That's probably a bit more than what I actually need but whatever.,2020-05-18 15:42:39
gm1799,fr0vcq5,GerstNowitzki,Also I don’t know if I should swap out that respawn speed perk on the shirt. I have another shirt with ninja squid and 2 main power up with like ink resistance I think. And I have shoes with 2 main power up 2 special up.,2020-05-18 13:13:32
gm1799,fr13bxm,invisime,"No.

In all seriousness, here are a few splatling threads I've left big comments on: [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/SplatoonMeta/comments/ftcp5l/is_this_a_good_gear_set_ill_take_any_tips_for_the/) [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/SplatoonMeta/comments/fzolnu/is_this_good_hydra_gear_im_trying_to_learn_it/) [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/SplatoonMeta/comments/fxgfrn/what_is_a_good_gear_set_for_the_heavy_splatling/)

A lot of that advice will apply to the Ballpoint, but some of it won't.

I've been picking up the Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau lately, and here's what I've noticed gear-wise:

* Run Speed and Ink Resistence are still pretty big deals, but the close range mode's fast inking + the ability to store a charge makes them slightly less important than for most other splatlings. You could skimp a little if you wanted the slots for something else.

* Maybe it's just my lack of ink discipline in general or my relative inexperience with this specific weapon, but I find the ballpoint to be a real ink hog. I recommend Ink Saver Main -- especially if you like spending a really long time shooting in long range mode.

* If I'm playing Ranked/League, I like using three subs of Sub Power Up. Faster jumps to your beacons can be a really big deal for your team. In Turf, there should be fewer splats in general, which means the beacons get used less.

* Similarly, I think I would only use Special Charge Up for Ink Storm in Turf. You'll live long enough for it to matter, and that special is only so-so in Ranked.

Hopefully, this helps. Stay fresh!",2020-05-18 14:34:07

Then there’s throwers, cheaters etc and the game has no way to call them out during the match or to penalize them. There are players that are under 10yrs old that make it to X.

lgf5t9,gmwav1e,spidertrolled,"I think something that hasn't been mentioned yet is that you don't need any tactics sense to reach X if your weapon technique is good enough. Or in other words, you can carry yourself to X just by slaying only - your bad tactics habits won't be called out by other players until you hit X or really mid X, as everyone in S+ and below also have real bad tactics sense.   This is maybe because there just aren't enough players with that sense to push everyone else down out of X, though imho X ranks should be deranked out of inactivity too. 

 I play a variety of weapons in ranked - backline, forward, midfield- and the other thing I've learned is that I can pretty reasonably predict which team wins as soon as the comps are revealed.  Matchmaking screws over team comps on a pretty regular basis, and if your skill level isn't >2500, then you're likely behind the 8 ball if the comp is against you and you're not a forward / short range weapon, which is the most tactically flexible kind of weapon.   If you only play weapons like Nzap or Ttek, you might not be aware that your teammates on other weapon types are specialized and are locked into certain positions and roles, and they have to intentionally play off-type if the matchmaking God threw a curve ball at them. That in itself is a big disadvantage to your team, even if all four members of the team are on their game that night. 

Hell the weirdest solo match I played was 7 backlines on wahoo tower.  I ended up playing  forward with my Hydra, flanking the eliters to splat them close range. God that was so weird - it's not how Hydra was meant to be played at all, but it's what that specific game called for and we won handily that way.

y8mp49,it3berq,Gloomy_Woomy,"Weirdly enough, LDE seems like the standout to me. Unless you're cracked enough at jump tech and general evasion that you can consistently make good use out of it (in which case, hell yeah go off), there's probably more you can do with that main slot.

If LDE is to reduce splat bomb consumption, I think just outright replacing it with sub saver wouldn't be the worse idea. That way you don't have to worry quite as much about it for the _entire_ game, rather than when the enemy team has a few dozen points left. Splat bombs are busted, and even on a weapon as potentially ink hungry as DS, you want to abuse that as much as possible.

In the same vein as sub saver, ink recovery might also kinda maybe work. Generally, you aren't going to be engaging as soon as you throw a bomb, so ink recovery would decrease the amount of time you want to wait in between throwing the bomb and engaging with dodge rolls. If you pick off an enemy (or they just stop fighting you), then you'll also be recovering more of that ink that you just spent rolling around & be topped off if you need to fight soon after. Note though that both splat bomb & dodge roll have an ink recovery penalty/buffer, where for a certain amount of time you can't recover any ink (idk how long for bomb, but for dodge roll it's 60 frames).

If you wanna make use of that 1 sub of QR, having a main of QR would make it more justified, though from what I heard even 1 main 1 sub isn't as much as people would like. You could also replace the 1 sub as people suggested and have your head gear be comeback, which according to sendou.ink gives the same ink efficiency bonus as LDE at 42 points remaining, plus swim speed, run speed, and special charge.",2022-10-20 17:00:20

Clams too; wipe them twice/thrice in one push and you’ll keep the basket open long enough for teammates to come with clams for a KO. Sometimes you do need to get a quad by yourself but the trouble is staying alive through it all. It’s also why special farming doesn’t get people far; they’re sacrificing the opportunity of securing important kills in lieu of turfing for their special. 

You have to play aware; watch any movement of paint through peripheral vision or maps; if you know where they are, it is easier to react. One thing that really changed my gameplay in S+ is just taking a moment to just watch the field, be more aware of teammate positions, and most importantly, my hub. I find I can double team on an engagement just by being more aware of where enemies are vs where my teammates are. I managed to get to X rank just by playing smart; but staying there is another story. I had to improve other metrics aka aim, movement, reaction time, etc in order to stay there so it’s a give or take on what getting to X rank means to you.

Not to say it’s useless though: it’s good for retaking objectives and if you use your surroundings, it can devastate.

Basically don’t expect it to win you 1v1s or save you.  It works best used on the objective or at key moments when you know the opponents can’t escape.",2020-12-31 07:31:54
knl3jf,ghm0nb1,invisime,"One thing not mentioned in the other comments (which all raise good points, upvotes all around), is that splashdown can negate almost all subs and most specials.

A well-timed splashdown will save you from splat/suction/curling bombs -- even in a rush. It will obliterate someone's unpopped bubbles. It can even help you escape and punish a hammer (with a touch of height advantage).

Splashdown is overrated as a panic button, but underrated as a sub/special counter.",2020-12-31 15:14:55
knl3jf,ghlil76,cyberskunk2077,"It's really not that great, but you can do some things to make it a bit better:

- Most people know how to splat you when you use splashdown from even ground, because the height is easy to predict (the dummies on the grates is the practise room actually have the exact height). If you jump down from high ground on the other hand, you rise higher into the air, which can give you the slight advantage you need to survive. Nevertheless, it is still very possible to splat you. 

- Use splashdown preemptively. Most people anticipate that you only use it when under attack or near some enemies. If you are surrounded by enemy ink, want to paint the zone or need an instant ink refill, just use splashdown for that, it's not wasted. 

- Be ready to superjump to the front line, as soon as you have splashdown ready. Checking the map regularly is very important in general, but even more so, if you have your splash down ready. When you see a teammate pushing, just jump to them, there will probably be some enemies around. Jumping to the objective (Rainmaker, tower, zone, either basket), when it's under attack, is probably never a bad idea. 

- Use splashdown, when you are about to die, to save special. If you die when using splashdown, you only lose 25% of your special meter instead of 50%. This can be reduced further significantly by only one sub of special saver. When you respawn, just paint a bit in your spawn and jump with splashdown right back into the action. 

( - Additionally: The non-lethal damage of splashdown comboes very nicely with an indirect hit by the Blaster or one hit by the .96 deco (with 2m1s mpu). I'm afraid, I don't know the exact numbers for the splatroller, but if you hit someone with non-lethal damage and use splashdown right after, they probably won't be able to get away. )",2020-12-31 11:17:44

knl3jf,ghmflua,jusbecks,"Take my comment as a disclaimer to all the others, cause while what they’re saying is true to some extent, I believe it’s a bit of an exaggeration as well.

Most people are either taking into consideration professional play or “high X” to answer your question, but that doesn’t mean that what they’re saying is true to B rank, or even to low X (under 2300XP).

I’m usually under 2300XP, and I can guarantee you that most of my teammates **can’t** shoot down Splashdowns consistently. And while it’s true that the special **can** be shot down, even by accident, that is how most specials in the game work: they’re not invincibility specials, and when using any special there is risk of dying.

Also, with any special you won’t get value out of every time you use it. Sometimes you won’t be able to pop your Bubbles, sometimes your Stingray won’t kill anyone, sometimes your Booyah Bomb won’t hit anyone or anything useful, and so on... Of course, you’re looking for value when using your special, but that doesn’t mean you’ll find it at every single use.

So, that, I believe, is a truer answer to your question: Splashdown requires “skill” to know how to get the most value out of it, but it can fail just as any other special.

I believe no one here can tell (with data to support the claim) whether Splashdown gets shot down more than Inkjet does. And even if it does, it’s a completely different special, with a completely different function and used in completely different contexts.

Up to higher X, I’m sure you’ll get a lot of value out of it, specially in lower ranks. So, in that context, it’s not a bad special at all. But as I said, the other comments are true, cause the answer with regard to the meta is that Splashdown is considered low tier. But **so is the Splat Roller**, for that matter. Within the meta, rollers aren’t considered good, and if you ever find one in professional play it’s most probably going to be the Carbon.

But then again, that doesn’t mean that Rollers won’t destroy most teams in lower ranks, and even in X, if you know how to use it and you’re good with it.

So, if you’re looking to fit within the meta and to play the “most optimal” kits, Splat Roller isn’t it. But unless you actually have plans on trying to go professional, I’d say play the things you like, and see for yourself whether it works or not.",2020-12-31 17:27:52

The second person in the entire world to hit 3000 x power did it with tenta tek so people are starting to call tt tek one of the best guns in the meta

But also anything that fits under strategies like fluid roles and priorities and META. People are liking the inkjet L3 more, and people are also starting to build comps without backlines (after nearly 5 years of saying that they absolutely need a backline)

Fluid role guns can range from vanilla pro (Supportive sub and special but can play skirmish and flex in some cases because of mpu), to c jet (Good range for an anchor, can also flex and be a supportive stingray bot), and also splash o matic (Its *nearly above average turfing* makes it a good supp/flex but it can also slayer to move with the match)

C jet is good but it's not a good backline on it's own so people like to run c jet with a sniper or splatling. (Also applies to explosher and dynamo in some cases)

META can range from mpu guns (Bamboo skirmish, Bamboo anchor, Vpro flex, Kpro skirmish/slayer, tetra skirmish/slayer) to guns that have good turf coverage and can only serve as support for the most part (Heavies, Ballpoints, Nzap, Inkbrush, Octobrush (even though nobody uses it anymore because inkbrush is miles better) and have set strategies for different maps and modes.

Essentially, as you add more of certain ability, the less effective the next increase becomes.

So really at the very most you want 1 main and 6 subs of swim speed but even that's probably too much, even with ninja squid.

My suggestion would be:

Take Build 4, then make Stealth jump shoes with 1 sub each of quick super jump, special saver and Ink res instead of the current ones. 

The speed difference will be minimal but your jump will be hidden and decently faster, you'll lose significantly less special on death and you'll have to touch enemy Ink when swimming significantly longer for it to interupt you.",2022-12-22 20:45:17

Yes, obviously there are! But it can still lead to observable changes with enough chunks. I have a nearly perfect set of quick respawn (i.e., 1 main, 9 subs). That is *just* enough to get me down to 5 second respawn. But it was already at 6 seconds around 1 main, 3 subs... Making the set completely pure would only bring it down towards 4.5 seconds (I think, based on graphs from inkpedia). 

Not sure if swim speed up works the same way, but even adding a 5% boost with a full gear set makes a difference (even though it removes the possibility of using other abilities). Maybe it is just placebo effect, but running pure sets is fun. I'd rather squeeze out all the potential of one ability based on my playstyle/mood, than have minor effects from several abilities.

Or rather, mix two ability sets (like you have done here with RSU and SSU). I often run pure sets of sub saver and special charge up. Best of the both worlds!

Plus, with splatfest tee you are probably in the sweet spot of effectiveness using your pure headgear/shoes.

gkrnie,fqszg16,Lil_lilly_11,"its viable, the JR is unique in that it has a fat ink tank. run some subsaver and throw those bombs.",2020-05-16 10:23:00
gkrnie,fqtgt0t,David_O14,"Maining the splattershot jr. Is completely fine. I know a guy who got top 500 in clams with the jr. once, just because it's the beginner weapon doesn't make it bad or anything",2020-05-16 14:18:27
gkrnie,fqtcpm8,PrebuiltMangos,"With the fat ink tank, its great if you wanna be a bomb main.",2020-05-16 13:36:39
