1bd0e27,kujpg1u,TheWeeViolist,"Your dad is awesome.

ETA: he probably doesn’t realize the work involved in creating a cake like this. Perhaps you could suggest making it together? That way you don’t feel overwhelmed with recreating a meme cake. You two can bond over the experience, he will get his cake, and you will have help. He may also think twice about requesting overly-complex bakes from you in the future if he sees the amount of work it requires.",2024-03-12 17:09:34
1bd0e27,kujqqwv,onupward,"I’d probably start with a few sheet cakes that I then carve down to the right shape.  You could use rice crispy treats but I think it’s doable if you stack the cakes correctly and dowel them (I use boba straws personally). Also, I don’t know if this cake is intentionally squished that way or not (it seems very unstable toward the back of the train) so that would be something to address.

I’d probably block my cakes like this (see image below) and that bit in the middle I’d attempt to connect with either cake paste as I call it (it’s cake shavings mixed with butter cream until I can mold it aka cake pop mix) or I’d try using rice treats there.  I think the fondant in this image is cracking because there’s no support on that slope so maybe putting a thin piece of wood and laying cake on it and then covering it would work.  I think it’s entirely doable but will take some planning and depends on your skill level.

You could use cake boards in between layers as well and you’ll want to use a firmer cake, than say a chiffon.  You could do a mixture of cakes and put something more dense at the base and slowly use lighter cakes ascending.  Now I kinda wanna make this weird ass cake 😂🤣 anyway, enjoy the process and do your best 🫶🏼 I believe in you!

1bd0e27,kujo5h8,ELIMINADO,"Check our cake carving tutorials online and how to build cake sculptures. Get on Food Network and Discovery+ and watch the hell out of cake building competitions. See the way the train is sagging under the weight of Thomas? The build is bad and wasn't designed properly/no reinforcements. It will very quickly fall apart. 

Typically stuff like this is made almost entirely out of edible (and non-edible) items other than cake. Only one small part of this could be cake for it to be structurally sound and that would the caboose part of the train. 

Fondant and lots of it. You could do buttercream but it would take forever. Rice krispies for everything else beyond the caboose. The structure just won't handle being all cake. Modeling chocolate for smaller details.

Alternatively, use cake pop mix instead of rice Krispies for some parts of the build.",2024-03-12 17:02:24

1gqufvm,lx0x680,PurpleyPineapple,"Are you absolutely certain this recipe isn't missing an ingredient? Namely... Flour?

There's not enough protein and/or starch in this to thicken this into anything even vaguely approaching what you described. If you expect a custardy type texture, it will need a higher ratio of eggs. If you're expecting a brownie like texture, you need some starch as the amount of cocoa isn't going to add enough structure and let the filling set.

It's possible something has gotten lost in translation here as is often the case with old family recipes. 

I'd say try mixing in a 1/4 cup all purpose flour and see how that works for you.",2024-11-14 02:35:27

1an0emc,kppg836,_cat_wrangler,"Its the lavender pieces yes.  You can see it.  Its too heavy to be suspended and the pannacotta isnt setting fast enough to counteract it so its falling to the bottom when ~~baking~~ setting.  After that its down to your mold's shape and flexibility 


*edit*  i notice this recipe isnt baked but the concept is the same, when you are adding these ingredients the pannacotta is still loose and thin, so they are settling on the bottom, I think the mixture needs strained more first as the original recipe pics do not show pieces INSIDE just on top(maybe cheesecloth could help this), and it seems like theres minimal food dye added to theirs too.  You could try dyeing the gelatine mix on its own before adding to the other ingredients for potentially better effect though if you are using anything other than water/alcohol based food dye (say powder or gel or oil) it may be separating because of the weight of those pigments/particles. 


*edit 2* also if you want it MORE purple (the original recipe photos really do not appear very purple to me AT ALL) you could use considerably more, they only call for 2 drops.  But either way I think it will be pretty with or without colour, but the lavender pieces are causing the weird effect.",2024-02-09 23:09:39

You'll need a large cake board to place the cake on. After it's finished baking, let cool for about ten minutes, and then place the cake board on top. With one hand on the bottom of the cake board, pull the cake pan towards the edge of the counter. With your other hand (wearing an oven mitt), flip it over onto the cake board. Tap lightly on the top and slowly remove the cake pan.

You take a tall square mold, use it to cut the cakes to the correct size, and cut acetate to size to line the sides. Then place quartered strawberries with the flat sections flush against the side. Use a piping bag to fill up the gaps between the strawberries with whipped cream. You can add extra strawberry pieces in the middle if you want, if you do then pipe a thin layer of cream on the cake first. Fill up with cream to the top of the strawberries. Add the next sheet of cake and repeat, finishing with the third sheet of cake and a thin layer of whipped cream. Take the mold off, gently take the acetate off, and use a pallette knife to smooth out the top layer of cream and to remove any cream that's creeped between the strawberries and the acetate.

1aj2e2u,koyq5sv,Beansbestie,"To me this looks like they were over mixed and the oven temp wasn’t hot enough/they weren’t baked long enough.

A few tips from when I first started with macarons:

- weigh EVERYTHING
- a tiny bit of cream of tartar will help the egg white mixture stabilize 
- I would start with an over-whipped/really stiff egg white mixture as it was harder to over mix that way.
- be verrrry careful with the macaronage. When I was first learning the consistency I would fold the ingredients together about 50 times to start (seriously, count them). For this step make sure you are scraping around the side then pushing through the middle, not just mixing around the bowl. Once you have counted to 50, start testing the batter consistency after every 1-2 folds. Once you have learned the consistency, you don’t need to count. I can tell immediately when I’m done now.
- I love the figure 8 test, I usually scoop a significant amount onto my spatula and turn it down to make the figure 8. If it breaks at all during the 8, keep going. Once you can make the 8 STOP. It should be thick, like pancake batter, flowy, but not runny. When in doubt it is better to have a slightly undermixed batter than overmixed. Under mixed gives you bigger hollows but longer maturation time with the filling will usually fix that. If you are still confused about consistency - default to YouTube videos. I can’t tell you how many hours I watched when I first started! 
- invest in a couple oven thermometers. It’s super important to know the oven is the temp it’s supposed to be. And if possible don’t use a convection oven because the fans can create lopsided macarons. 
- buy a couple silicone mats. Amazon I think has packs of 2 that even have the circle outlines so you know you are making consistent sizes. The silicone mats help with keeping the circle shape and not having the sides come out a little lumpy.
- try flipping your baking sheet so your mat/macarons are on the very bottom. The curvature of the baking sheet creates a better airflow for macaron baking.


Wishing you all the of best luck!! Please post your next batch - I am sure they will be successful.

ETA: don’t pull the macarons out of the oven if they are still wiggly. They can have a very *slight* wiggle when pushed gently with a finger, but anything more than that, they are not done baking! And let them cool fully on the sheet before removing them, or the bottoms may stick",2024-02-05 01:40:29

Contrary to popular belief. Poppy seeds don't really cause you to fail a drug test. Poppy seeds are washed and processed which removes about 90% of the opiate content. Additionally, poppy seeds are intended for human consumption are harvested about three weeks after the flower opens to give the seeds times to become nonnarcotic for that very reason. So the amount of poppy seeds you would need to consume to reach the testing thresholds is multiple tablespoons of poppyseeds of seeds with a conspicuously high opiate content.

Muffins and cupcakes are usually a pretty different ratio of ingredients so that you get the denser muffin texture that will pillow over the top. For a cupcake you don’t usually want a crunchy edge, and this perfect dome will be perfect for frosting! 

I’d say, if you want a more muffin texture maybe try to find a plain muffin recipe and compare the ingredients and see what you might want to change. I’d guess more flour and maybe a bit more fat would help with your desired look, but that’s also off the top of my head lol.

But without restarting from the beginning best and easiest thing you could do is put each of them in a tiny lil on-theme muffin paper to make them easy to pick up and eat (possibly with a theme-appropriate toothpick or whatever those slightly larger things used for single serve desserts are (fork like but very small and not usually more than 2-3 tines)",2024-09-26 23:14:34

Boiling a jam based glaze to get it to hard crack will just burn the jam giving it a bad taste and you won’t get a clear glaze

Since you worked with this product and it looks like you know what you’re doing, this might go without saying, but just in case. lol. Please don’t warm these up. Warming them up even in small increments can mess with the consistency and make the oils in the marzipan seep out which can ruin your hard work. 

I also would not use confectioners sugar on top of the jam glaze. I think that would give them a cloudy look. 

The mini cupcake liners is a good idea!

One (15 oz.) can of sweetened condensed milk.

One 8x8 pan and some parchment paper or aluminum foil.

Line the pan with the paper or foil.

In a saucepan, heat the milk, but *do not boil it.* Just get it warm. I'd use a medium setting on the eye.

Pour in the chips and stir them gently until they're melted.

Pour that into the pan. Refrigerate it until it sets.

1al2s3q,kpcl9mt,Real_Persimmon3340,"I'm not an expert, but the ""chemical smell"" comment reminded me of a failed mug-cake experiment I did years ago. I don't remember exactly what I did, but it was pretty standard except the part where I added 2-3 times the amount of baking soda I was supposed to (maybe I even added baking powder, I don't 100% remember) - but I thought it would somehow make it rise even more lol.... What ended up happening is that after it was done in the microwave, it had some kind of weird smoke coming out of the middle 😂 (can't even make it up lol). At first, you'd think the heat was too high and it was steaming- but no.. It had the horriblest chemical smell to it. Other than that, it looked fine except a bit gummy inside. I took the tiniest bite and immediately spit it out and washed my mouth out. 
So basicallyyyyyyyy, I learned not to mess around with the recipes in baking too much, and to absolutely never over-do baking soda/powder. At the time, I also thought it mightve had to do with either the shape, or the material of the mug I used(i think it was clay on the outside?) , since that particular mug always smelled like chemicals when I put hot stuff in it ever since. On the other hand, I had success when I followed the recipe and used a specific glass mug with a proper flat bottom and sharp sides going up.",2024-02-07 16:30:27

How old are your flour and yeast? If you're ready to give it another go, I'd buy fresh ingredients, and skip the cold proof. There's nothing wrong with doing a cold proof, but when you're trying to get to the bottom of a problem, it's good to eliminate variables until the problem is gone, and then introduce them one at a time.

[*Why Is My Dough Turning Yellow?*](https://thrivecuisine.com/food-questions/why-is-my-dough-yellow/) suggests that exposure to light and air can affect the carotenoids in flour to create a yellow color. If the flour was already on the old side, and the dough then spent all night in the refrigerator, perhaps it passed some sort of tipping point that made the surface turn very yellow.

&#x200B;

>the most concerning part is the smell. It smells very strongly of some sort of alcohol/ hydrogen peroxide chemical. 

I'm sure you know that fermentation creates alcohol and the smell you're smelling isn't just that. Is it possible that some other substance made it into your dough? Could you have used self-rising flour by accident?",2024-02-07 16:13:01

Grass-fed tends to be much softer, which is great for cakes. Regular butter tends to be a little more stable at room temp, so that's great for buttercream as it won't get too melty. I think Kerrygold might be grass-fed, too, but I'm not entirely sure. Just check the packaging and you'll typically find out.

I would normally say the green color might be from your baking powder reacting with something acidic in the batter. Since there's nothing acidic I am assuming it's reacting with your bowl or mixing utensils. Copper bowls or utensils can react to make your cake green.",2024-02-17 01:08:51

1asoy19,kqs5s37,cherrytarts,"Those ingredients are consistent with an European sponge (Genoise) or Pan di Spagna in Italy and I'm pretty sure that's what this cake should be.

What I think happened is you either underbeat the eggs - 10 mins should be enough but you need to watch for the right consistency and fluidity (Google ""ribbon stage batter"") instead of setting a timer - or you over mixed the flour, essentially popping all the air bubbles that were incorporated in the eggs. 

Flour should be added in spoonfuls and FOLDED in carefully with a spatula, - there are YouTube videos demonstrating this technique. This is the most important step of a Genoise.

The batter really does not rise much in the oven, as it relies on the egg foam for its volume, although there are recipes that call for baking powder.

Also, try baking them at a slightly lower temperature (160°C or 320°f)!

If you're going to try this again (I wouldn't)....

Mix the yolks and sugar until the ribbon stage (it will look pale yellow and ribbons will briefly form when you lift a spoon through it).

Whip the egg whites to a stiff meringue (add a bit of cream of tartar to stabilize them during the mixing process).

Add the flour to the egg yolk mixture and then gently fold in the meringue.  It doesn't have to be completely incorporated.   You want to maintain the airiness of the meringue.

* Get an oven thermometer and try baking at 325F
* Don't over whisk the eggs or overfold the flour into the cake mix
* Add some sort of fats like room-temp butter OR
* Whisk the egg whites and sugar separately, and then mix it with egg yolk and flour

1asoy19,kqsl3gk,oreganoca,"I didn't think I've seen a Bundt cake recipe with no oil or butter before. 

If I had to guess, it's overmixed and underbaked. You want to gently fold flour into cakes in about three additions,  and only until just mixed, otherwise you knock air out of your mixture and get gluten development that will make your cake gummy and tough. As far as beating the eggs and sugar, I usually rely upon what they're supposed to look like and how much they should have increased in volume rather than a set time. It can vary by the temperature the eggs are at, the specific mixer, design of the beaters, etc. I'd also try lowering the temperature to 325 and baking longer so your outside doesn't burn while the inside is cooking through.",2024-02-17 04:28:24
1asoy19,kqrz01h,primeline31,"I think that there's something wrong with the recipe.  There's no butter, vanilla or liquid (milk, buttermilk, cream) like most pound cakes, butter cakes or the famous whipping cream cake (it's on r/Old_Recipes hall of fame on the right side of that page.)

I also think that the eggs should be separated and the whites beaten stiff before folding in the rest of the ingredients.  You'd get more loft.

Could the flour that your mother used be self-rising flour and not all-purpose flour?  That has baking powder and a bit of salt already in it.

I did a search on 3 ingredient cakes and most of them call for a box cake mix, eggs and something else. [ ](https://www.facebook.com/recipeslearn/videos/311139797205710/)

There's one recipe on a Facebk page (I can't link it or the moderator bot will tell me to take it off) calls for 3 ingredients like your mom's recipe except that it calls for cornstarch instead of flour.  In this case, you separate 5 eggs, beat the whites until stiff, then slowly & gently beat/fold in the yolks.  Next gently stir in 2 cups of cornstarch (they used a whisk trying not to beat out the air bubbles) and baked it in an angel food pan that's buttered & dusted with sugar.  Bake at 350F for 35 min.

Could your baking powder be old?   It will lose its ability to create bubbles if it's old.

Best advice I have for beginners - get a scale and weigh your ingredients as opposed to using cups as measurements, get an internal oven thermometer (I’ve had ovens that were wrong by more than 50 degrees from the stated temperature), and always go by any descriptions of doneness as opposed to strictly following recipe baking times (ie, look for the right levels of browning, do a skewer or toothpick test, or get a thermometer so you can check the internal temperature of some of your bakes)

In addition to helping with humidity and overbaking (which is usually the cause of cracks like that), it also helps with the texture of the cheesecake itself. Gives a smother creamier texture vs eggy texture if that makes sense.

1h2xokl,lznfk7g,ManMeetsOven,"Cracks normally happen for two reasons, the cheesecake is overcooked or it is cooled too quickly. Both can happen as well but either of these will cause it. 

For overcooking the first thing I would suggest is getting heavy duty foil and place the springform pan on it. Then pull up the sides to top of the pan. Then get another sheet of foil and repeat but rotate the pan 90 degrees. I do it a 3rd time to help keep water from getting in rotating another 90 degrees. 
While the oven is preheating bring a kettle of water up to a boil. Place the cheesecake in a roasting dish with high walks and pour the boiling water around the side and place in the oven. 
You want the water to be boiling. If it isn’t the top of the cheesecake will cook until all of that water gets to 100C or 212F. The reason for the Bain Marie is because water only gets to 100C or 212F. This will gently cook the cheesecake. 
Next when you want to check for doneness tap the side of the springform pan with a spoon or something. It should wobble like set pudding. 

Now for the cooling process (this takes forever or well it’ll feel like it) turn off the oven and prop it open with a wooden spoon. Let it cool in the oven for at least an hour. Place it on the counter until it cools to room temp 1-3 hours and then you can put in the fridge.

I use a cookie scoop for mine but even a spoon might help to get them baked properly. Try to get them the same size. And I like a soft cookie so I pull them when they're not quite done in the middle as they continue to finish on the hot cookie sheet after you pull them. They also firm up while cooling. 

For a first time I would stick with a tried and true recipe from a reputable source. There's a good reason why so many people just use the recipe on the back of the Nestle toll house bag, for example. 

Chocolate varies. Make sure that you use the right chocolate. Baking chocolate is not formulated the same way. 

When you first start baking I don't recommend deviating from the recipe. Browning butter and creaming butter are different.

1bkhguc,kvzhook,jm567,"A couple thoughts:
- Regardless of the recipe, if you are measuring your flour by volume with measuring cups, it will be hard to get consistent results. The amount of flour can vary a lot when measuring with measuring cups. Better to weigh your ingredients to get consistent results. 
- when you baked, did you use the setting in your oven with the lines at the top and bottom? If so, that’s the “roast” setting that uses both the bottom heating element and the broiler element. For baking cookies, cakes, pastry, bread, etc I would use only the bottom element. That’s the one with a line only on the bottom (at about 5 o’clock on your dial). 
-  most chocolate chips are made with additives that help them maintain their shape. They don’t melt well. If you want the chocolate to melt in the oven and get soft and gooey, buy good quality baking bars like Ghirardelli brand. Then use a big knife and chop the chocolate into chunks. I don’t do a lot of sweet baking, but I suspect someone here knows which brands of chocolate chips are made without the additives so that they do melt well.",2024-03-22 01:59:05

Pink is just pale red, so pale red-brown is pink-brown. Buttercream is white when properly whipped, so mixed with red-brown you've made pink-brown buttercream. It's also possible the red pigment in it is interacting with the buttercream in a way that's bringing it out more than the other colours.


In other words, I don't think the colour is wrong, you just need to add more. But you might never reach the shade of brown you want, it will always be red-brown.

I was hoping you had included other pics of what you’re perceiving as ‘failed’ bakes. Had you iced them, they’d look pretty identical to the pics. 

Which leaves me questioning why they’re cut without the marshmallow fluff icing? Why make fluffernutter bars if you’re missing half of the inspiration for said bars?

1fkumzh,lnywaxl,SheepPup,"Ok here are possible issues from what I think is most to least likely:

1) baking powder is expired. Check the date on it and make sure it’s still good. If it’s a recipe that uses baking soda and acid check those to make sure they’re still good too

2) you’re over mixing. If the leavening agent is good then texture like this can happen because you mixed too much and developed the gluten in the batter/dough too much. Too much gluten development means chewy rubbery texture 

3) cutting too soon. Baked goods continue to bake with the residual heat inside them even after you take them out of the oven. If you cut into them immediately while hot you collapse all the little air bubbles inside and squash the crumb of the baked good together, that can leave it weird and dense and gummy. I mostly see this issue with bread that’s cut straight out of the oven. Let it cool fully before cutting 

4) wrong kind of flour. Different kinds of flour have different amounts of gluten in them. Pastry and cake flour have much less gluten than all purpose flour, so if your recipe is calling for one of those and you’re substituting it might be too much gluten",2024-09-19 23:23:59

If the temp was lower than it should be, it would have caused the butter to melt, but not the sugar, which is why you're seeing a lot of grease but still have sugar granules.

If it was a brownie recipe you cant eat them.
If it was a cupcake thing, it might be somthing you can eat with frosting or on ice cream but also doubt it. 
I would bet there was too much levening for the ratio, so baking powder. Could be you put too much in or missed some of another, like flour. Or it was also too wet from too much shortening or butter.  That will cause the overflow, caveing and also the hole texture. 
Even if the texture is ok, i bet it might taste ok when you first try some but will have a bitter after taste back of the mouth, root of the tounge area after 5 or 10 seconds.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20221225085307/https://blog.fantes.com/pizzelle/](https://web.archive.org/web/20221225085307/https://blog.fantes.com/pizzelle/)

**First**, you should know that you will find it easier to use a stovetop pizzelle iron with good results, if you adapt the ingredients of your batter recipe to create more of a dough. Often, you can do this by simply adding flour. Batters generally give you a lighter tasting pizzella, so experiment with your recipe.

**To season the iron**, coat the plates with a vegetable oil and heat on the stove for 5-10 minutes. Flip the iron every minute or so, to heat both sides evenly.

**If using a dough recipe**, roll pieces into small balls before placing on the plate and squeezing the handles shut. Start small to avoid a mess on your stove. Attach the handle clip to bake the pizzelle evenly thick.

**For the first few pizzelle**, add the batter or dough and cook for about 1 minute, turning the iron over every 15 seconds or so. As the iron gets hotter during baking, pizzelle will bake faster. Throw away the first few pizzelle, as they will have soaked up the excess oil from the seasoning.

**Baking time** will also vary from between about 20 and 60 seconds based on the temperature output of your burners. The direct heat of gas burners is generally hotter than the indirect heat from electric burners, but either will work well with a little patience and experimentation. If too hot, they bake unevenly; if too cool, they’ll stick if you peek.

**After baking**, remove stuck-on food while still warm, and wipe surfaces with a cloth. Lightly oil the steel handles, to prevent them from rusting; if they rust, a light sanding and a little oil will restore their finish.",2024-12-12 22:00:55

1akdzn6,kp7aq4d,prosperos-mistress,"I'm gonna have to disagree with other commenters here. Without being able to taste it or inspect it in person, I don't think the chilled dough did this.  Even if you froze the dough balls, they would spread and change shape. They didn't change shape at all.  
Taking that into account and looking a little closely at the picture of the dough balls, I think it's possible you added too much flour, it looks kind of dry. This is easy to do when you're using imperial measurements and you aren't careful when measuring your flour.

If a recipe calls for a cup of flour for example and you scoop into the bag of flour WITH the measuring cup, it can compress the flour and you get more than you're supposed to get. If you don't have a scale and can't measure in metric, a good trick is to scoop with a spoon from the bag of flour, into the measuring cup, and then level it with something like a butterknife.

Hope this makes sense. Also, if you're thinking about baking more often in the future I'd recommend picking up a digital scale. I do most of my recipes in metric now and it's far more accurate, and accuracy is important in baking.",2024-02-06 17:17:01

French sounds like it's the easiest but it's actually the trickiest to get right because it's difficult to get the sugar dissolved without overbeating. I prefer the Swiss method where you dissolve the sugar in the whites over a double boiler then whip it. Very glossy, and more of a window of doneness.

1frng69,lpeznek,MobileDependent9177,"You’ve already got your answer on why. It’s obviously over whisked. But you can stop this from happening, even if you don’t use cream of tartar or lemon juice. You can usually also save over whipped whites. 

Make sure your whites are room temp, this is also very important. 

Before you start adding your sugar, you have to mix the whites until they look like soapy bubbles/frothy. Do not start adding sugar before this stage. So you have to stand by your mixer and watch it. I know it sounds tedious but once you’ve done it a handful of times, your internal clock will kick in and you don’t have to stand around the whole time. It really doesn’t take that long anyway. So, medium speed, soapy bubbles first then start adding your sugar in small increments until all the sugar is incorporated. Once it’s shiny and smooth, stop. Remove the bowl and use the whisk to check the bottom and make sure no whites were left behind. At this point, if there is a little bit of the whites that didn’t incorporate, you can easily whisk it by hand so it doesn’t go over. If you accidentally overmix again, you may be able to salvage it by adding a little more room temp egg whites. Here’s a video that should be helpful for you:

350 seems low.  Should it be 350 with fan? Which would be equivalent to 375 without fan, but usually don't use fan for muffins.  Checked the few muffin recipes i use every so often and couple were 375, a couple at 400, and one at 425. 

make sure the oven is fully preheated.  Ideally it should be at temp for at least 10 minutes before putting stuff in.  Otherwise it's mostly just the air inside at proper temp, and when you open the door, that heat all escapes, then the oven has to go about heating the air, the oven walls, and your food.  If the walls have some stored heat they'll release it and get back to temp quicker. 

get a cheap oven thermometer, almost guaranteed your oven knob is not accurate.  None of them really are.  So your 350 that seems low, could really be 325 which is really low.",2025-02-12 20:53:49

And yes, there are specific techniques to make souffles so it makes sense to assume a souffle cake is going to behave more like a souffle than a traditional cake.

It appears the original cake has been cooked in a sloped pan as indicated by the flat ""bottom"" and sloped edges. It appears it's been turned over onto the flat top and the base is the exposed side. I would guess it's probably baked in a ceramic or maybe glass pan, not metal. 

Based on pictures alone, you are most likely not using the ""correctly shaped"" pan for this, because a souffle needs a little help creeping up the sides of its vessel. You're using a pan that doesn't encourage souffle-like rising. I would guess the parchment is also an issue preventing the right type of expansion of a souffle cake.

EASY FOOLPROOF SWISS MERINGUE BUTTERCREAM (¾ recipe) -adapted from cakepaperparty.com	
Note: This recipe is enough to frost 18 cupcakes.

Use a paper towel soaked with white vinegar to wipe down the mixing bowl and whisk attachment of the stand mixer.

Whisk together in a heat proof bowl set over simmering water: 170 grams egg whites (fresh or carton egg whites), 341 grams granulated sugar, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract  

Continue whisking until the mixture reaches a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit.  The temperature is right when no sugar granules are felt when a bit of the liquid Is rubbed between thumb and index finger.

Remove from heat and cool to a cool room temperature, 60-65 degrees Fahrenheit.  This can be done in the freezer, refrigerator, an ice bath, or at room temperature.

Meanwhile, beat in a mixer bowl with the whisk attachment on medium-high for about 1 minute until creamy and slightly lightened: 3 sticks butter and 60 grams powdered sugar, optional (Note: I do not feel the original recipe is sweet enough.)

Add and beat well: Any ingredient used to flavor the buttercream (lemon juice powder, espresso powder, maple syrup, apple cider reduction, strawberry reduction, melted chocolate, 270 grams peanut butter, 258 grams/12 full sized melted peanut butter cups, etc.)

The bagels also appear to be quite wet. It can be challenging to use a home refrigerator for proofing because the other items in it can up the moisture content. It looks like in addition to the temperature being off this also happened.  If you want to do a cold proof put the pan into a heavy plastic garbage bag and wind it around.

I see flecks of color all throughout your dough… is it possible that the green spots are just areas that had a higher concentration of malt powder or that something in the malt powder is leeching color into the surrounding dough? I wouldn’t think that the problem is your fridge if you covered this in clingfilm for the rise. Yes possibly your fridge is too warm but that would have only caused the mold to appear internally if something in your ingredients was contaminated, not contamination from the fridge itself.  I honestly would taste the green spot (being ready to spit it out) because if it’s mold, you will know it right away. And if it doesn’t taste moldy then I would bake a couple and see what they look like.

But delivery is everything when it comes to corrections or criticism. Yeah, someone might have made a silly decision to use cake flour instead of whole wheat flour, and it's silly that they expect it to get the same results. But the way to address that person is still with respect and kindness. Being snide, mocking, or harsh with one's critique can very easily push someone away from the craft, to feel inferior and looked down upon, and can hinder their improvement. By all means, tell a person what might have gone wrong and explain how it works, but I think it's important to do so with kindness and empathy.

It is beyond frustrating for folks who develop recipes to see this kind of random change and then confusion.Baking is a science more so than cooking.  With a dinner, you can change an ingredient or two and likely still have an edible meal.With a cake, change an ingredient and you can get an inedible stodgy cake.

If you want them taller and not to spread out as much, roll them out just slightly thinner so you can get a tighter roll on them and get closer to two full turns. Also, If you look at your first picture, the lamination in the center is at an angle. While this expands, this pushes the dough outwards instead of upwards. Try to get the very center of the roll to be perfectly horizontal. This will expand straight upwards and give you the height you are looking for.

1i5gl6p,m84sjq8,snrtlt,"These look great, especially for a home job! It's so hard to get quality laminated bakes without the same equipment that bakeries have on hand. 

The recipe and laminating seems sound, as others have said I'd play around with the proofing times. Try doing a second overnight proof once they have been shaped, if they need more proofing on the day of the bake do the water bath proof for a short while but monitor them, you want them big and with defined layers, but not too wobbly or they're on the edge of over proofing.

Maybe experiment with your baking temperatures as well - what works for the guy you got the recipe from might not be the best settings for your oven. You don't say if your oven is conventional or fan, but where I work we bake laminated pastries by preheating the fan ovens to 220C (428F), then turning it down to 180C (356F) and baking for 20 minutes with steam injection (you could throw a couple of icecubes in the oven as the start for steam).

 Those temps may not necessarily work for your oven, but more to illustrate how varying the baking temps can be depending on the oven. Preheating yours to a higher temp before baking might help with the initial rise in the oven though - heat is lost when you open the oven door to put the pastries in, and cold dough on a cold tray will pull down the temp more.

ETA: I just noticed that you're using all purpose flour, i'd experiment with a different flour before any of the other stuff I recommended above lol. A good quality strong bread flour will help you get nice defined layers, in my experience lower protein flours will get you a bready, closed interior.",2025-01-20 08:42:18

You can have as much yeast as you like but unless the dough is strong enough to capture the gas then it’s not going to rise. 

For strength you need good flour and good mixing to build gluten strength, look at doing the windowpane test like they do in sourdough.

lavaey,glrdxyk,Wowward,"I have been decorating nearly half my life now and tips I like to share with beginners is: 

First relax, it’s supposed to be fun 🤩!!

Praaaaactice....!!! You will never get any skill set without practice and trial and error. The nice thing about icing is it is very pliable so (when practicing repeatedly) you can scrape your decorations off, and either stick it in the fridge to firm back up or put a lil’ more powdered sugar in it to keep practicing with the same batch. 

**OVERFILLING YOUR ICING BAG**
I always always allllways tell new decorators to try to only put enough icing in the bag that you can handle comfortably. All too often when piping, doing cupcake swirls or rosettes decorators want to fill the bags to the brim and they are then struggling to both hold it and keep all of the icing from falling out the backside of the bag. It takes away any control you had of the bag as well so your designs will often end up looking shaky or sloppy. 

Less is more. Too much often takes away from the elegance. 

I lost my train of thought but Lmk if you have any questions in particular",2021-02-02 18:08:50

lavaey,glquecm,stinatown,"YES, definitely know the feeling. 

What I've found helpful is splitting my project over a few days--the worst feeling is trying to decorate after midnight the day before the party/event, so I try to avoid that feeling as much as possible. I'll make the frosting earlier in the week, then make the cake layers a day or two early, then do the assembling the day before, so I feel fresh and excited for decorating. Some items, like gumpaste flowers, can be made ahead of time. 

This also allows me to clean up completely after each step--while it's more clean up work total, I find that starting decorating with a totally clean kitchen is less stressful than one where I have a sink full of dishes and batter splattered on the counter. 

Having the right tools helps--pastry bags and tips in a lot of varieties, a turntable, a bench scraper, flower nail, etc have made my life way easier, even though they can sometimes feel superfluous for a non-professional. (Space is also huge--trying to decorate in my tiny apartment kitchen is such a pain compared to my parents' kitchen in their house, so when I can, I plan to bake/decorate there.)

I'm my own worst critic, and I've been known to get really discouraged when I'm like 60% finished because the cake isn't looking the way I imagined. Most of the time, a) the last 40% really brings it together, and b) the people I bake for are impressed even if there are things I wish I did differently or that I don't like. Keep in mind that it's supposed to be fun, and worst case scenario, it's still gonna taste good.

1ch1f2g,l20xn07,Electrical_Mousse299,"Hi! I love that you are getting into making cookies 💞. 
Here are the 5 biggest mistakes people make in baking.
1. Don't over mix! Always (unless the recipe directs otherwise) start with wet ingredients in your mixer. Mix your dry ingredients in a separate bowl and slowly add your dry ingredients into your wet ingredients and mix just until they are combined. It may even be a little crumbly down at the base. Just use a spoon or spatula to lift it up and mix it into the rest of the batter. 
2. Either weigh (in grams) or spoon your flour into your measuring cup. If you scoop your measuring cup into your flour it gets packed down and you end up with too much flour leading to dry, bready cookies.
3. Make sure your baking soda and baking powder are in date. Make sure you are using the one called for... Baking soda requires an acid to activate it whereas baking powder has the ingredients to activate itself (add liquid and poof... raising).
4. Don't substitute ingredients until you've made the recipe correctly at least once. Then you know what to expect (this is very different from cooking where you can throw things together or make substitutions and things will come out good). For example, bread flour, all purpose and pastry flour are all flours but have completely different purposes and arent really interchangeable. Bread flour wants to develop gluten b/c of it's protein content of 12-16%, A/P for has a protein content of 10-11 so it will develop gluten if you overwork it but it won't develop it on it's own, Pastry/cake flour had a protein content of 8-9% so you can mix it a bit more and it won't develop gluten nearly as quickly as the other ones. Additionally, they require different amounts of liquid to be hydrated so if you add the same amount of liquid to bread flour and pastry for the bread flour will still be on the dry side and the pastry flour will be wet 🤷🏻‍♀️.
5. With cookies you typically want the center a little wet looking still when you take them out. They will keep cooking a bit after you take them out. 

I'd say you probably had a few things from 1, 2 and 4 (maybe bread flour instead of all purpose?). Hope this helps and don't get discouraged; you will get better!!!",2024-05-01 00:52:17
