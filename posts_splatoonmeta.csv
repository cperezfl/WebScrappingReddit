ys7uhw,Why Ink Recovery is (nearly) useless,2022-11-11 11:33:39,Pegthaniel,https://www.reddit.com/r/SplatoonMeta/comments/ys7uhw/why_ink_recovery_is_nearly_useless/,32,"I’m moving this from a comment I made in the regular /r/splatoon discord (with a little cleanup and bonus Splat Bomb-centric math) because I see so many build questions here, and so many players including Ink Recovery in their builds. Here’s why Ink Recovery is fundamentally (nearly) useless. I’ll be going over mathematically how it (almost) never saves time in a variety of situations. Hopefully this helps people!


First of all, Ink Recovery doesn't save any time refilling a main weapon when compared to Ink Saver Main. Here's a basic case: you win a fight with Splattershot, and it takes 27 shots (default full tank is 108.7, so this is 24.8% used, about one quarter). I picked it so it would be in that 25% range, but it could be any number and the following calculations will apply the same way:

* With 10AP of Ink Saver Main, you use 21.5% instead to fire the same 27 shots. Let's compare that to having 10AP of Ink Recovery.

* In the Recovery case, it takes 2.68 seconds to fill a full ink tank, so filling 24.8% takes **0.666 seconds**.

* In the ISM case: it take 3 seconds to fill a full ink tank, so filling 21.5% takes **0.643 seconds**.

As you can see, a main of ISM is better than Ink Recovery. You get additional shots for very long fights, and for a fight that takes the same number of shots, you take a tiny bit less time to refill to 100%.

Let's see if it falls off. We'll compare 10AP of each to 20AP of ISM, using up the same 27 shots to make my calculations easier. 

* 10AP each: it takes 2.68 seconds to fill a full tank, so filling 21.5% takes **0.575 seconds**.

* 20AP ISM: you can fire 144.62 shots, so 27 shots is 18.7% used. It takes 3 seconds to fill a tank, so it takes **0.560 seconds** to fill back to 100%.

As you can see, it doesn't fall over even at 20AP, or 2 mains. What about 30AP ISM, against 20/10 split, against 10/20 split?

* 30 ISM: 0.495 seconds.
* 20 ISM, 10 Recovery: 0.500 seconds.
* 10 ISM, 20 Recovery: 0.521 seconds.

Hopefully this shows why it doesn't make sense to ever run Ink Recovery if your problem is an ink hungry main weapon (but let's be real, nobody should be running 30 or more AP of ink saver or ink recovery). 

OK, what about mixed usage? Surely Ink Recovery has an edge there, because it impacts both sides of ink usage compared to the savers. Let's make another basic scenario where you use your Splattershot's bomb and the fire until empty in a fight, and have to refill right away:

* 19AP of Ink Recovery uses up the full tank to throw a bomb and shoots until dry--32 shots.
  * It takes **2.45 seconds** to refill.

* For a 10AP ISM, 9AP ISS build tossing a bomb and using 32 shots, you retain 11.6% of your tank (14 shots). That means we need to refill 88.4% of the tank.
  * It takes **2.65 seconds** to refill.

* You might think ""OK, this is a clear Ink Recovery win, right?"" Well, lets add a new twist: we get into the next fight after exactly 2.45 seconds. Lets see what each weapon can do:

  * 19AP Ink Recovery can throw 1 bomb and shoot 32 shots, or shoot 108 shots.
  * 10AP ISM, 9AP ISS build refills `2.45/3 = 81.7%`. Add that to the 11.6% of the tank remaining, we get 93.4%. If we throw a bomb, we have 37 shots. If we don't throw a bomb, we have 117 shots.

As you can see, while you *do* save time refilling, you aren't as capable in the next fight as the Ink Saver build. Running the Savers makes you more flexible. If you don't have time to fully refill, you can still output more shots than the Ink Recovery build. If you can refill for more time, you have extra capacity that the Ink Recovery build will never have. 

There's one situation where Ink Recovery sort of wins. You can compare a single main of ISS or ISM to a single main of Ink Recovery in the same maxed out, mixed use situation:

* After the first fight: 
  * Ink Recovery refills completely in 2.68 seconds.
  * 1 ISM refills completely in 2.88 seconds, has 5 extra shots before refilling.
  * 1 ISS refills completely in 2.76 seconds, has 8 extra shots before refilling.

* What you can do if you enter a second fight after exactly 2.68 seconds and then throw a bomb:
  * Ink Recovery can shoot 32 times.
  * ISM can shoot 30 times.
  * ISS can shoot 38 times.

ISS still wins, but not ISM. Even then if you can refill ink for just 3 more frames (164 instead of 161), ISM is doing just as well. For every frame after, you're doing better.

And now a bonus discussion on the ink economics of bomb usage. Lets look at Jr going for double splat bombs under the maxed-out effects of LDE. This includes some Ink Recovery, but we’ll pretend it doesn’t exist in 1 build vs the full 24AP in another just to show how ineffectual it is. We’ll also simplify double bombing to use up 100% of the ink tank under LDE (it’s actually about 99%).

* There is a 1 second delay after throwing a bomb before you can refill. 
* Without any Ink Recovery AP, it will take 4.32 seconds to refill, including the 1 second of delay.
* In a pretend scenario where you have 12 Ink Recovery AP, it will take 3.95 seconds.
* In the real world of LDE giving 24 Ink Recovery AP, it will take 3.89 seconds.

Overall, the Ink Recovery part of LDE saves you 0.43 seconds out of what would otherwise be 4.32 seconds, which translates to about 25 (26?) frames. This 25 frame time savings would come at the cost of 8 subs (or a bit more than 2 mains + 1 sub) if it wasn’t bundled into LDE for free. Compare how a *single sub* of QSJ saves you just as much time as 12AP of Ink Recovery—22 frames or 0.37 seconds. Admittedly, you Super Jump a lot less than you refill ink, but hopefully this paints a full picture of how unimpactful Ink Recovery is.",Sí,100

So when I got Splatoon 3 a couple weeks ago and it felt like my opponents were always better than my team, I ignored it assuming it would all even out eventually… but boy was I wrong. 

Ever since launch almost 70% of my games have felt completely unwinable due to the skill gap between our teams. At first I assumed that I was really rusty and I was the weak link dragging down my team, but after a while I realized that I’m consistently best player on my team by KDR, objectives, etc. And while my team rarely feels like complete and total noobs, we’re constantly matched against players with much higher game knowledge and skill expression than us. I’m constantly seeing people utilizing armor frames, advance movement tech, and specific camping spots like they’re A+ rank when I’m stuck down here in C-. 

The only thing I can think of is that it’s because I implemented my Splatoon 2 data and thus it matches me with more experienced players but that doesn’t apply to my own team? I don’t know but it’s honestly so frustrating it’s killing my excitement for the game which makes me really sad because this was the generation I vowed to really dig into the competitive side of this game. 

Is anyone else feeling this? Any tips on how to keep the game fun even when losing 70% of matches?",Sí,71

The mechanics, the complexity of the weapon, and the type of play it provides clicks with me more than any other class currently in Splatoon 3. It's just a shame Nintendo doesn't know how to implement the class properly. 

Regardless, there's still fun to be had because, if used properly, it can counter some of the obnoxious meta and hyper aggressive play currently out there. Being able to absolutely shut down reckless approaches makes matches feel more fun. Forcing my team to a neutral or advantage state with in these incredibly linear maps with my Brella and vacuum makes movement feels a bit less restricting. 

Tenta Brella, when it works, acts like a bandaid to the developer's questionable design choices. It brings some order to the shooter meta and balances the dominant aggressive playstyle.. when it works. 

With that said, please buff the Brella class.

yso05q,Building for the Splattershot Jr. in Patch 1.2,2022-11-11 21:40:09,ELIMINADO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SplatoonMeta/comments/yso05q/building_for_the_splattershot_jr_in_patch_12/,15,"Howdy. Call me Paz. This is a long one.

In my first few posts I took a look at [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/SplatoonMeta/comments/yhusj9/analyzing_procharas_builds_in_patch_12_range_build/) [builds](https://www.reddit.com/r/SplatoonMeta/comments/yn2hoz/analyzing_procharas_builds_in_patch_12_explosher/) that ProChara uses, and why [LDE isn't as much a given](https://www.reddit.com/r/SplatoonMeta/comments/ykjw4w/no_surprisingly_you_shouldnt_run_lde_on/) in builds as most people think it is. Today I want to try my hand at making a loadout guide for a weapon. Most would agree it's intuitive to start with the Splattershot Jr., but truely, it's a weapon with a lot of plasticity in it's loadout choices. 

All of that stems from the simple fact that the Junior is a lightweight weapon with an already a cheap special and an expanded ink tank. The intersection of these three aspects of the Junior give it an inherent value package of Swim Speed, Ink Efficiency, and Special Charge. 

**Junior's Base Value Abilities**

You might squint at the last point. Even if I argue that most of the special guages for shooter class weapons sit at round 200p you'll point out that other competitors with Big Bubbler also sit around 180p. Simply put, those weapons aren't shooters, and they ***especially*** also aren't a shooter that paints as well as the Junior. 

Weapons that typically have 200p gauges require 1.1 SCU (13AP) to match 180p gauges. As an aside this is somewhat deceptive as SCU is actually a bonus to how your ink charges the gauge, but it's easily expressed by a reduction in gauge for practical purposes. Lightweight imparts an ever so slightly stronger bonus than 0.2 SSU and 0.2 RSU, and a 10% larger tank is akin to 0.2 ISM (6AP) or 1.0 ISS (10AP). As an imperfect but close example, [this](https://sendou.ink/analyzer?weapon=40&build=SCU%2CSCU%2CRSU%2CSSU%2CISS%2CU%2CRSU%2CSSU%2CU%2CU%2CU%2CU&lde=0) is what the Junior has built in compared to the average normal weight weapon with a 200p special.

**Junior's Place in the 1.2 Meta**

With Sloshing Machines, E-Liters and a Crab Raves taking charge of the place, you might think that the humble dollar store squirt gun every one starts with can't stand toe to toe with the other titans of the meta, but the Junior carves it's niche as the premier Support and Big Bubbler user in our current environment. 

Big Bubble is superb in many game states for it's ability to force situations with it's absurd shield and built in jump point. In SZ you can place it comfortably on the Zone to defend or take, in Rainmaker you can offer safe passage for the carrier and secure points. In Clam Blitz it can help extend a push on to the goal, and everyone already knows it's use on Tower Control. 

Finding ways to get in and get Big Bubbler into a obnoxious position is core to the Junior's gameplan, and it's access to Splat Bombs and a large ink tank assist us immensely here. Indeed, superb paint, easy Bubbles, decent kill potential and the ability to comfortably bomb spam set it apart from the other candidates with Big Bubbler as it's special.

With it's access to the latter in mind lets move on to three sample builds. None of these are by any measure an end all be all selection of builds, but exemplary of how many options are easy to fit on the Junior while keeping the support gameplan mind. I will be trying a few different options to each loadout to showcase just how flexible the Junior is, and explain how they benefit it.

**Build 1:** [**Double Bomb Junior**](https://sendou.ink/analyzer?weapon=10&build=ISS%2CISS%2CQSJ%2CIRU%2CISS%2CISS%2CIRU%2CSCU%2CSJ%2CIRU%2CSS%2CRES&lde=0)

Ever since the 3.2 patch in Splat2, the Junior has enjoyed being the only weapon that can toss two Splat Bombs back to back with much less Ink Saver Sub investment in it's loadout. Really, you only need 2.1 ISS (23AP) meet the threshold to double bomb, but that leaves you all but nothing in the tank. Adding one extra Sub of ISS to the build will afford you an extra seven of shots to ink your feet if necessary, or to fire a lethal round onto an opponent. 

You might think it an unorthodox include 0.3 Ink Recovery Up which is widely considered to be [pretty useless in most builds](https://www.reddit.com/r/SplatoonMeta/comments/ys7uhw/why_ink_recovery_is_nearly_useless/), but with the Juniors expanded ink tank, we also have a longer time to recover our tank to full. The 0.3 IRU here help us cancel out the extra 1/3 second wait and bring us back to a normal recovery time of just under 3 seconds. I wouldn't fault you if you wanted to cut one or all three out in favor of something else.

With 0.1 SCU we shave off five points from the special gauge any more and we only get four points for our investment, and lastly we include the compulsory value subs of 0.1 Special Saver, Quick Super Jump, Ink Resist imparting the benefits:

* Lose only 41% of your gauge on being splat, rather than 50%
* 3.27  total super jump time, from 3.63, a time save of 0.36 seconds, while  also lowering the frames you are vulnerable to attack from 80 to 58. In a  60FPS game like Splatoon, that means you are only out in the open for a  little under a second rather than 1.2 seconds.
* Helps  you walk in enemy ink a bit better and hopefully save your membrane  from the unfortunate position your ambitions have landed you in. It also  Lowers DPS while in enemy ink from 18DPS to 12DPS, adds 10 frames  before you start taking damage, and lowers the max damage you take from  enemy ink from 40 to 38. 

You'll usually see some splashing of those value abilities somewhere in builds, and they will be present two other loadouts. Stealth Jump is pretty close to the only ability in the game that everyone agrees is a given and I can't argue against it. At worse you deny the enemy team information on your whereabouts and at best you save yourself from being camped.

**Build 2:**  [**LDE + Ninja Squid**](https://sendou.ink/analyzer?weapon=10&build=LDE%2CSSU%2CIA%2CIA%2CNS%2CSSU%2CSCU%2CSS%2CSJ%2CSSU%2CQSJ%2CRES&lde=0&effect=LDE)

This is closer to what you'll likely see used by a competitive player. Ninja Squid assists in approach, skirmishes and more importantly help us in placing more aggressive Big Bubblers. Last-Ditch Effort at max bonus rolls all of the ink efficiency abilities we need to double bomb and cancel out the extended ink tank recovery time, and in the only game state where we'll want to double bomb from safety, disadvantage. 

There's a lot of conversation about the place of ""supports"" in Splatoon 3 specifically, but the collective vibe I am getting from everyone is that the line between support and slayer is blurred. A good support player knows when to get in and get messy, and so a support weapon is also judged by it's ability to put effective kill pressure as well as prepare specials and put down paint.

Getting back on track, 0.3 SSU here help us cancel out the speed penalty from Ninja Squid. You'd need 0.5 or 1.2 SSU to completely cancel it out and get back to the lightweight bonus, but here we managed reach just under normal weight's swim speed. It's just as valid a choice to forgo trying to bandaid the swim penalty in order to run whatever is more compelling to you in those three slots as lightweight weapons aren't hit as hard by the penalty. 

0.2 Intensify Action enjoys a place on many shooter builds, usually anywhere from 0.1 to 0.3. While one might question the use of reducing a spray-shooters RNG while jumping, you get some pretty good mileage out of just 0.1 or 0.2 in this context (15° to 13.5 at 0.2 which is close to the grounded 12°) so if you jump often in your skirmishes or when trying to hit a target on a ledge this is a compelling choice.

The value trio makes it's return along with it's 0.1 SCU Buddy.

**Build 3:** [**LDE + Cheap Bubbler**](https://sendou.ink/analyzer?weapon=10&build=LDE%2CSS%2CQSJ%2CRES%2CSCU%2CSCU%2CBRU%2CBRU%2CSJ%2CIA%2CSSU%2CSSU&lde=0&effect=LDE) **(This also happens to be** [**Chara's Build**](https://sendou.ink/u/chara/builds)**)**

I guess I couldn't avoid semi-analyzing a Chara Build.

This is a build with LDE that instead has a focus on having on demand Big Bubblers. The gauge reduction from 180p to 162p isn't clean, but if we circle back to what I mentioned in the ""Junior's Value Abilities"" section, SCU was never a reduction to the special gauge, but a bonus to the way your ink charges it. So, with that in mind, I added points of SCU until we hit heavier diminishing returns. Adding another Sub beyond this point only gives us a 3p reduction.

0.2 Sub Power Up is a popular choice in weapons that like to spam their bombs, which adds speed and distance to throw. It's something of a ""feel"" ability in the same way you might add Swim or Run Speed Up passed a reasonable point but you like the ""feel"" of having those points. A common rule with abilities is that the first 3AP - 10AP are the strongest, so with this choice we splashing the strongest amount of Sub Power Up with our free slots.

0.2 Swim Speed Up is following the same theory of just adding the most beneficial speed we can to our build with the most competitive amount. 0.1 Intensify Action is a little over a 1° reduction on the jump shot deviation so, we might as well. Once again, the value boys are back in town.

**Conclusion**

The Junior is an often looked over weapon in favor of the seemingly stronger or more flashier options available in Splatoon, but it doesn't make it any less interesting a choice nor a weaker competitor for a spot in a composition. It's superb kit and inherent value make for a powerful choice inevitably that opens the door to theorycrafting with abilities in Splatoon.

I hope I have demonstrated just how many things you can run on the Junior that still play into the objective of it's simple game-plan of safe bombs and big bubs. You can easily mix and match the small groups of Subs abilities in these builds to find a combination that you enjoy or prefer.

wkzm8b,Some of my thoughts on the Splatoon 3 direct,2022-08-10 14:59:20,ELIMINADO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SplatoonMeta/comments/wkzm8b/some_of_my_thoughts_on_the_splatoon_3_direct/,10,"I'm only talking about the 4v4 gameplay in Splat 3. Nothing related to quality of life features, single player, Salmon Run, or cosmetic options.

**New Stages:**

* The new stages look fine. I think Nintendo has started to hit their stride on stage design to not go too far on gimmicks as they can absolutely ruin the functionality. Case in point, Wahoo and Shellendorf.
* Museum, Hammerhead, Mahi Mahi, and Flounder are all confirmed to come back. Those were, in my opinion, the best stages in 1 and that's great they're returning. Though I'm not sure I like that they removed the grates in Hammerhead.
* I like that Inkblot, Sturgeon, and MakoMart are returning. But Wahoo??? Removing the timed bridge into mid would've made this map so much better, but they didn't even do that it seems.

**Main Weapons:**

* I don't know how to feel about Stringers, to be honest. The OHKO on a full charge is nice. It seems to paint decently. But I will only be able to tell with time how it competes with Chargers.
* Splatanas are... interesting. I think with the charge-into-OHKO mechanic looks cool. But I worry it's going to be countered extremely easily by Dualies and the Squid Roll.
* Single Player showed Blaster still having Jump RNG, but it doesn't look as bad. Hopefully Range has none.
* At 21:42, the Heavy Splatling appeared to have virtually no ground-fire RNG. A nice buff for the weapon.

**Special Weapons:**

* New Killer Wail looks good. Kills pretty fast. That's all I can say.
* Tacticooler is a really cool rework of Ink Armor from 2. It'll probably be a nightmare trying to get value from it in Solo Queue but for competitive play I'd say there's potential.
* Wave Breaker doesn't look very strong. I think they should make the tag-lines expand faster.
* Reefslider looks REALLY cool, and a very interesting successor to Splashdown. But like Splashdown, I worry how easily it's going to be countered as time goes on though.
* Tenta Missiles are back, but I don't think they're going to be *that bad.* They'll probably still be good, especially if you pair it with something like Zipcaster. The specials in this game appear to be overall stronger than in 2 and with the new mobility options I think it's safe to say they won't be as broken here.
* Ultra Stamp is back. Nothing to say about that, really.
* Inkstorm is back, but we don't get to see how much it paints. I would like to see them greatly shorten the cooldown period before a user can charge them again.
* Booyah Bomb is back, and I think it could still be good. It's one of the best designed specials in 2. But it's strange that it's in this game with the Triple Inkstrike. And from the one scene we saw it in action, it doesn't appear to paint at all.
* I don't believe it's a bad idea to bring back Inkjet in this game. But if it wants to compete with the other specials in 3, they need to buff it. I believe making it as good as it was at the start of 2 would be fair.

**Kits (I won't be talking about ones that were revealed in previous trailers):**

* Splat Dualies with Suction Bomb + Crab Tank. Basically a successor to its Kensa kit in 2. This is a good one. And with the absence of Damage Up weapons countering it, they have a chance to shine again. 
* Splat Roller with Curling Bomb + Big Bubbler. The sub already pairs well with the main weapon, and I believe that this survivability special would compliment it as a weapon that likes to shark.
* Glooga Dualies with Splash Wall + Booyah Bomb. A perfect kit for the main weapon, and v52 is already confirmed to have Splash Wall + Killer Wail so there won't be one that blatantly outclasses the other.
* Splattershot Jr. with Splat Bomb + Bubble Shield. No surprise. Jr. can only be as good as the special its attached to, so we shall wait and see.
* Sploosh with Curling Bomb + Ultra Stamp. Not bad. It compliments the main weapon's rat-oriented playstyle.
* Splash with Burst Bomb + Crab Tank. That will be strong.
* Aerospray with Fizzy Bomb + Reefslider. Main weapon's extremely weak so it likely won't break any grounds but that kit interests me.
* N-Zap with Suction Bomb + Tacticooler. It's a successor to its '85 kit from 2. It'll likely be strong, but also like its predecessor a really boring weapon too.
* .96 Gal has Sprinkler + Vacuum. Looks decent.
* Jet Squelcher has Hit Marker + Vacuum. Not bad but probably will be outclassed.
* Luna Blaster has Splat Bomb + Zipcaster. Splat Bomb is perfect for the main weapon and as a short range slayer it'll synergize well with the special.
* Splat Brella has Sprinkler + Triple Inkstrike. If they buff the Sprinkler's paint, it'll be good.
* Tetra Dualies has Autobomb + Reefslider. If Reefslider is good, then this will be REALLY strong.
* Splatana has Torpedo + Ultra Stamp. It's a kit.
* Heavy Splatling has Sprinkler + Wavebreaker. Underwhelming.
* Dualie Squelchers are still the replacement for Dual Squelcher it appears, and it also has Wavebreaker.
* E-Liter has Wavebreaker
* Hydra Splatling has Booyah Bomb. It'll be good for the weapon as a survivability option, like it was on Heavy Remix. Nothing else I can say.
* Flingza Roller still has Tenta Missiles.
* Sloshing Machine might have Inkjet. The character that is always seen holding the Machine was also using the Inkjet in its presentation.
* If you look closely, Undercover Brella has Inkstorm.
* Gold Aerospray has Booyah Bomb.

**Abilities:**

* No Damage Up. Thank God.
* If Intensify Action benefits the user for the entire duration of the game, it will be good. Perhaps broken.
* Run Speed Up looks way stronger than it did in 2.

**Other Changes:**

* The new Checkpoint system in Rainmaker is a necessary rework for the mode in my opinion, especially for Solo Queue.
* Clam Blitz now only requires 8 clams to make a football. That's a good change, it will make the mode WAY less stall-heavy.",Sí,33

The only thing is that it kinda sucks against backlines. If you have lethal bombs and chuck it at a Hydra Splatling they have to swim away from the bomb, lose their charge, and will possibly be forced to move to a dangerous spot to get out of a really dangerous spot like the blast zone of a lethal bomb.

The response to these kits have been overwhelmingly negative among competitive players who want new weapons to have competitively viable kits.

There is some debate over Slosher Deco as well ─ does the performance of Stamper indicate that a Slosher with Zipcaster will be worth using despite not having a sub?

xpsd4h,What do you think it looks like the strongest weapons in the game (3) are as of now?,2022-09-27 20:53:47,_JIBUN_WO_,https://www.reddit.com/r/SplatoonMeta/comments/xpsd4h/what_do_you_think_it_looks_like_the_strongest/,16,"I’m interested to see what people think since the meta is very much still developing. Personally, I’ve noticed these to be particularly strong:

• Sloshing Machine - I don’t think I need to explain this one.

• Splash-o-matic - The weapon itself is *pretty* good, but the kit makes it ungodly. I’ve ran into way too many teams running two or more of these and spamming crab tank as much as possible, which was especially obnoxious in tricolor.

• Splattershot/Hero Shot Replica - Once again, the kit is what elevates this to insanity. Suction bombs and trizooka make this one a force to be reckoned with, and i’ve honestly had more luck with this thing than with any of the other weapons I play despite having much more experience with those.

•Pretty much all of the dualies - The special changes on the dualies make them even more formidable. Dapples were already one of the most potent slayer weapons in 2 but now they have *Tacticooler* of all things to buff the entire team and effectively cheat death in the process. Tetras, too, were already solid in 2, but held back by the presence of Splashdown; replacing this with the new Reefslider definitely brings more potential out of them. And Splats, of course, got Crab Tank. Along with suction bombs. Some of these kits are just madness, huh.",Sí,32

Some squids were having trouble finding high-level competitive Splatoon streamers so I thought I'd compile a list for all of you. I hope this helps anyone fiending for some competitive Splatoon.

[ThatSrb2DUDE](http://www.twitch.tv/thatsrb2dude) - In my opinion, DUDE is the best player on this list (no offense to anyone else). I just don't know how he does it. This man is just a monster at Splatoon. He is also super entertaining to watch. I **highly** recommend checking out his streams, if you haven't already. 

[LuxLuxora](http://www.twitch.tv/luxluxora) - Another very entertaining streamer.  She has a very personable personality and it translates very well to her streams. Of course, she is also very competent at the game.

[FLC](http://www.twitch.tv/fiveleafclover) - FLC's streams skew more towards informational than entertaining. He does an amazing job of explaining his thought process behind his decisions. Out of everyone here, FLC's streams have been the most helpful for me as a player looking to improve. 

[Kaysick](http://www.twitch.tv/kaysick) - Kaysick is the Any% Splatoon WR holder. He's a really chill guy that seems to be naturally great at this game. His streams are definitely super fun to chill in. The coolest thing about Kaysick's streams is that he occasionally analyses viewer gameplay. This is definitely the place to go if you want more direct help.

3krrnx,"For this game's solo matchmaking to have any semblance of reason, you MUST lose points in S rank in squad battles, or gain NO points in squad battles EVER",2015-09-13 11:03:04,Ultramus,https://www.reddit.com/r/SplatoonMeta/comments/3krrnx/for_this_games_solo_matchmaking_to_have_any/,18,"I am a competitive splatoon player, most recently taking 1st place in the SCL tourney and 7th in Booyah Battle. I'm a member of the most competitive clan in this game and scrim regularly. I perform extremely well in 90% of my matches. My squad battle winrate is obscene.


That all out of the way, I am still S rank, despite playing the game a ton and having the results to show I'm a top performing player. Previously, people talked about the matchmaking being hell in the mid tiers and people rightfully saying that if they were good, they would get to A+, this was largely correct, as many of us who were skilled made it to A+ no problem. It was also not a struggle getting to S. That said, right now, getting to S+ is as much a crapshoot as anything. Let's talk about what happened.


Player Y is a B+ player in solo. He squads up with his S ranked teammates and gets carried to A+99, backs out and lucks into a win and now he is S 30, and he needs to lose *8* games to derank back into A+. Chances are he may win 1-2 of those games, and because it's +5 pts a win and -4 points per loss, luck of the draw will keep them in S *indefinitely*. If you've ever wondered why you have S ranked players going 0-8, 1-12, et cetera, it's because they simply have no idea what they are doing, they got carried to S and have stayed there despite their best efforts. I have had innumerable matches of >3 k/d, 10+ kills each match, spamming quick respawn on my gear and pushing the objectives as hard as possible, and I'll still lose. And then I see that 2 people on my team went wildly negative, and both of them have *rapid blaster*.


I know that rank is meaningless, but this is simply not *fun*. When everyone aggregates to the rank it ruins the entirety of the ranked based matchmaking. The solution is simple, you should gain and lose points based on squad battle, and it should give you fewer points for wins. S+ should also extend to Squad Battle as well, to improve the matchmaking on that front.


I don't know *why* splatoon ranking is so broken like this, but I feel like it needs to be addressed that it is fundamentally **wrong**, as it naturally inflates players rank in squads and is not harsh enough demoting people in solo once they have gotten S, and it subsequently ruins matchmaking for *both* queues. I hope they realize the error of their ways soon, because I'm almost done playing solo queue because of it.",Sí,28

Yes, in most if not all situations the armor variant is the preferable choice, and that's my best weapon. But after seeing the results of it in some tournaments (Kiver) and using the weapon myself, I think it deserves some looking into.

I believe the weapon really does have a viable niche in Splat Zones on maps where it can easily farm its Inkstorm, such as Reef, Kelp Dome, Snapper, Musselforge, etc. If used to its fullest potential, the amount of map control the weapon can create is actually pretty insane. I've played on Zones maps where I was able to keep the map painted almost completely, leaving the opponents with very few options and if they tried pushing they would be weakened if not outright denied by my Inkstorm, and I  could easily follow through with killing them. 

Sprinkler was once considered one of the best subs but is now one of the weaker ones due to the heavy reliance on bombs in this current meta, but that doesn't mean it's useless. Spamming sprinklers and shooting means you can easily charge your special in 10 seconds or less. I still would prefer a Splat or Burst Bomb but I find that it still helps a lot in 1v1s by being a distraction, affording you more time to shoot, and limiting your opponent's movement options. 

So yeah, that's my opinion on the weapon. I wouldn't use it outside of a few maps in Zones but I really do enjoy the weapon in those circumstances. Feel free to discuss with me or offer any contrasting views.",Sí,27

You don't need [to](https://youtu.be/vaMAuVGTDnI) [look](https://youtu.be/T4lXCvm6Y94?t=305) [hard](https://youtu.be/bZabqEcal_0?t=105) to find pros or any semi-competitive cephalopod calling for Last-Ditch Effort [nerfs](https://youtu.be/6wQeV_T8Kl8?t=349) or raving about the ludicrous 72AP it brings to a loadout for the low cost of one Main Slot. It currently dominates all discussion about builds as people will often ask ""Why no LDE?"" when looking at any build or explanation that doesn't at least consider the ridiculous ink efficiency value it provides.

I'm by no means arguing that it isn't a strong ability, from an objective value stand point it absolutely is, but that the benefits it provides are something you have to consider on every headgear slot before everything else is overselling it.

What I am going to put forward instead is that the weapon and kit LDE is on is a more important factor of what makes LDE good rather than the absurd value the ability brings to the table.

**The Breakdown**

Last-Ditch effort in Ranked/Anarchy starts activating the moment the enemy team is 50 points away from victory, scaling it's bonuses upward until the enemy team is 30 points away from victory. In Turf War it activates in the last 30 seconds of a match if you were curious, but the former is why the ability is the current center of attention. It's very likely you'll get value from it for a lot longer depending on when you start taking the L in a competitive map mode.

At max bonus you get 24 AP (or just over 2.1) Ink Saver Main, Ink Saver Sub, and Ink Recovery Up **each**, this is where the ""72AP-more-than-a-loadouts-worth"" argument comes from. Even if you don't get the max bonus your opponents only need to be about 47 points away from victory to get your value back in the main slot across the three abilities or triple the value of a Main at 42 points.

If that was hard to follow, the ability has been unchanged since it's buff in Splat2, Patch 4.7, so [the chart from the Splatoon wiki](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Last-Ditch_Effort#Splatoon_2) underneath ""Splatoon 2"" still has an accurate break down of ability point per enemy's score.

**The Analysis**

Setting aside the obvious observation that ink efficiency abilities usually take a secondary role to other abilities in a well rounded loadout, with a few exceptions, let's engage with the argument that the sheer value from LDE is so attractive that other Main options needs to have a compelling reason to take the head slot. The value proposition brought by LDE counter acts the other intuitive argument people will make: ""Why would I want an ability that only activates when I am losing, just win 5head.""

LDE has a similar dynamic as Quick Respawn, but in the macro perspective of a match in Splatoon; it's something of an insurance policy. If you were gonna win anyway, ink efficiency wasn't the reason. If something goes completely wrong, but your team stops the push just short of a loss, the bonus abilities may help stabilize and make the difference in bringing things back from behind.

However, the latter point is what I want to hone in on. There's an intersection of ink guzzling but potent main weapon, combined with a lethal sub and powerful special that needs to be met to make LDE unequivocally worth it, and only just a consideration if you only have one or two of these factors in a weapon's kit.

For example, the Ink Saver Main component isn't as useful on something like standard range shooters such as the Splattershot, .52 Gal or Splash-o-matic as they are generally regarded to be ink efficient with good play. The Ink Saver Sub component isn't going to be as useful on a weapon with a Sub that doesn't poke or can be spammed like Ink Mines, Squid Beakon, or Sprinkler.

Let's take two extreme examples at both ends of the spectrum to further highlight my point. The Undercover Brella doesn't need any more people dunking on it, but makes an obvious example of how 72AP worth of ink efficiency couldn't hope to save it from being one of the weaker weapons in the game and a further liability in disadvantage state.

Ink Mines aren't something that help you get in, zone, or harass the enemy team, but control the opposition on territory you already have, which really only covers advantageous game states and if we are charitably including theoreticals, neutral state. More shots from a weapon that has a slow time to kill even when at it's effective range means that the Ink Saver Main is really only useful to maintain paint up time. Paint that is in service to arguably the weakest special in the game, Reef Slider.

On the flip side, and I wager most of you knew where this was going, we have a weapon that sits on the aforementioned intersection of powerful but inefficient Main weapon, spammable and lethally annoying Sub weapon, and incredible Special that you want to farm as much as possible.

The Sloshing Machine's actions per ink and uptime go through the roof when you have max LDE bonus, whether you are zoning out the opposition with your [silly sloshing hit-boxes](https://twitter.com/Liar_178/status/1574075666483777536?s=20&t=ylhTnqyVk7Kuol3q4-P80Q) or safely spamming Fizzy Bombs to farm Booyah Bomb, it's got it all. LDE compliments the weapon so well that I believe it's solely to blame for the misconception that LDE should be ran on everything as it's basically the undisputed top tier of the current patch. The Sloshing Machine is a perfect storm of several competitive qualities that make it really strong, LDE not with standing, but that's a different conversation.

**Conclusion**

So what about the other weapons? The two examples I gave are clear cut, but does that mean that I think these are the only cases where you don't or do run LDE? LOL NO

I ultimately want to encourage people to think twice about slapping LDE every which way. The popular consensus that it is a given in any build is so pervasive that it presently flattens discussion about loadouts in a system that I firmly believe is designed to compliment your play-style, support a novel idea, or provide an answer to gameplay scenarios.

But when I play solo Q, I feel like it’s too much of a gamble to run OS just on the off chance that maybe someone will have armor on the enemy team. And as a charger main, I honestly can pop baller fast enough to my liking (2 shots), sprinklers and beacons are the last of my concerns and... what else is OS good for again?

Perhaps it’s cause I don’t know everything that the ability is good for, but I feel like it’s such an overrated ability...? I understand how it’s good in competitive, where sometimes you can almost be sure people will be running armor on their comp, but on solo...? 

I feel like you can get so much more value from some other ability that it’s guaranteed that you’ll get use of it, instead of having an ability that if the other team doesn’t have armor or baller then it becomes literally useless.

But since I keep seeing it in top charger mains’ builds in solo, I figured I should finally ask someone else who probably know better. Why should I be running OS?",Sí,24

I think sometimes people don't know what terms mean. Overpowered doesn't mean its infallible, or unbeatable. It doesn't even mean that it doesn't take skill. In MKDS, snaking was OP, but that sure took skill. 

I guess thats probably because OP tends to be used casually as a kind of salty slur. But that isn't how you use it when you talk about meta. 

And its not just Overpowered, but Underpowered weapons, Broken mechanics, or any of that stuff that sometimes feels like its sensitive issues. But that sort of stuff is just going to be a part of when you discuss balance AT ALL! 

Because splatoon isn't designed with all neutral stages, or neutral modes. Certain stages and modes are obviously designed to give clear favor to certain weapons, and that in particular leaves plenty of room to constructively talk about this stuff.


I want to see more talk brought up involving Overpowered whatever. Not here in this topic, but when it comes up and its relevant. If you have something to say, say it, and we can talk about how it might be right or wrong.

Even in rank B TC (my current highest) I can see how well it works with the curling bombs plus abilities like Ninja Squid and Stealth Jump, but I'm not entirely certain what the value of Splashdown is. 

Even in Turf Wars people can shoot me down mid-animation. Hell, I've shot other Splashdown users down without even meaning to. Plus, it's not too difficult to escape the instakill radius in a lot of situations. The only ""safe"" way to use Splashdown is mid-superjump, and while this is excellent for nuking the tower, it's not always a possibility (need to charge it + teammate needs to be on/near the objective, or in heated firefight).

Thus, my question - how good is Splashdown, really?",Sí,23

Hammer needs more protection from the front, an actual lethal explosion hitbox, and fewer startup frames. Curling bomb should charge faster and/or cost less ink to throw. Thoughts?

Outside of Slosher Machine hard countering Brella's due to to a hit-box oversite and canopy bugs, there are some major issues with the weapon.

This thing kills even less consistently now.  The one shot hit-box requires the user to be nearly as precise as a tri stringer.  Aiming just a hair off will deny you of any reasonable positive result including 2 shot kills.  Fall off, though not exclusively a Splatoon 3 problem, has an arguably worse problem now.  Due to these DPS problems, winning 1v1s is extremely hard if you cant take the 3ish seconds to launch the canopy.  Oh, right, the weapon doesn't function well with Nintendo's current network infrastructure (enemies shooting you through Brellas etc.).  I was not struggling nearly this much before Splatty 3 arrived.  They changed the weapon in ways so subtly worse that I'm not even sure if my observations are factually true.  All I know is that this weapon feels less rewarding to play now.
